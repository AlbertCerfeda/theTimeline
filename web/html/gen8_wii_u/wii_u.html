        <h2 id="s1"> Introduction</h2>
        <p> The second 8th generation console is the Wii-U, a stationary gaming device manufactured by Nintendo and released in late 2012. Intended to be a successor to the legendary Nintendo Wii console, which became one of the most succesful gaming devices over all generations, Wii-U was a revolutionary and unique device under many aspects. Some of its features were not implemented in other contemporary competitors and, since the discrete (but not excellent) success of the Wii-U and after its discontinuation in 2017, Wii-U could be considered the only console with some particular features we will cover in the following sections.</p>
        <h2 id="s2"> The hardware </h2>
        <p> The console itself is based on an IBM Espresso CPU, derived from the PowerPC 750 / G3 architecture, the same used in G3 Apple computers, with some revisions to the design to keep it up to date. The chip contained three cores, running at approximately 1.24 GHz. PowerPC G3 was the same architecture used by Nintendo Wii's processor, which enables theoretical backward compatibility with the older console. There is also an ARM9 based co-processor, used for background activity and tasks performed in sleep mode. </p>
        <p> The graphics processor, codenamed Latte, contains a general purpose GPU (GPGPU) based on AMD Radeon R700 architecture and supports HD output, a feature that was missing on Wii despite being presents on all its competitors. Using a GPGPU is one of the revolutionary aspects related to hardware. Wii-U is the first console to use the graphics processor to accelerate other calculations and not only for 3d rendering; this helps in keeping a high level of performance, while not requiring a more powerful ( which often means hotter and more power hungry) CPU. There is also the old Wii's GX GPU, implemented for backward compatibility. </p>
        <p> The system integrates 2 GB of DDR3 ram, shared among CPU and GPU. However, the GPU has an integrated 32 MB eDram module. This memory architecture implies that there's no need for two separate memory buses for processor and graphics, avoiding complex, expensive and power hungry circuitry. </p>
        <p> Non-volatile storage is integrated in the form of a 8 or 32 GB internal flash memory. The device supports also SD and SDHC cards, to increase its memory capacity. USB storage devices, such as pendrives or external hard-drives, are also supported. The optical drive supports the older NOD disks developed for Wii and also new proprietary ones, that could store 25 GB per layer. </p>
        <p> The console supports Wifi, Bluetooth and Ethernet (via an adapter) for networking. It integrates USB, HDMI, Scart and Video Component ports. </p>
        
        <h2 id="s3"> Input devices </h2>
        <p> The actual revolution Wii-U brought to gamers is the Wii-U gamepad, a game controller with an integrated 6.2 inches resistive touch screen. This enabled basically two innovative features in gaming: 
<ul>
          <li> - the ability to play games without using a TV as output and watching the game on the gamepad screen;
</li>
          <li> - viewing different game contents on the television and on the integrated screen and having a different perspective, a concept that Nintendo call "Asimmetric gaming".
</li></ul></p>
        <p> The gamepad integrates also NFC, to interact with many other accessories, and a camera, to interact online. </p>
        <p> The main drawback of the device is obviously its relatively short battery life: every screen is power hungry, and the gamepad battery lasts approximately 3.5 hours. </p>
        <p> Nintendo also released the Wii-U Pro Controller, which is aimed at hardcore gamers or people who wanted a more traditiona experience, similar to the Xbox 360. This controller doesn't have a touch screen and is a classic gamepad, with an 80 hours battery life. </p>
        <p> Wii-U is compatible with all Wii accessories and controllers, such as Wii Remote, Wii Remote Plus and Wii Classic controller. They are actually needed if you want to play Wii games on the Wii-U. </p>
        <p> You can connect up to two gamepads, to let different players access to the same console. </p>
        
        <h2 id="s4"> Software and capabilities </h2>
        <p> As almost every 8th generation console, the Wii-U contains many multimedia and social features. However, with the advantage of the dual screen, multitasking is enabled on this console. You can view completely different content on each screen and do two different activities. For example, the home screen shows a list of apps and games on the gamepad's screen, while it shows social content on the TV. This behaviour can be modified. </p>
        <p> The console integrates an Internet Browser and its integrated with many video streaming services, such as Netflix and YouTue via dedicated apps, to watch videos. It's even possible to interact with Facebook and manage your social activity. Playing video content from DVD and Blu-Ray, however, is not supported. </p>
        <p> The online platform Wii-U uses is called Nintendo Network. Unlike other competing solutions, the platform as no subscription fee and allows players to play multiplayer games, buy digital content (such apps, for example) via the Nintendo Eshop, video chat with friends (with the help of the gamepad's camera) and so on. </p>
        <p> The console supports also Miiverse, a social channel that allows players to share content in selected games and in general interact with other players. </p>
        <p> In terms of compatibility, Wii-U is fully compatible with Wii games. The user who wants to play a Wii title must enter the Wii mode, which emulates the Wii menu and system. Games can be shown on the gamepad screen, but you have to use the Wii controllers to interact with the game. GameCube titles, instead, are not supported directly. With the Nintendo Virtual Console service, you can download games from other generation consoles, such as Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS and play them on the Wii-U. </p>
        
        <h2 id="s5" > market reception </h2>
        <p> As already stated, the Wii-U was a revolutionary device under many aspects. The dual-screen approach Nintendo introduced is still unique today, and gave players many possibilities that were (and still are) not present in other gaming consoles. Coupled with a competitive price point and the free online services (competing alternatives require subscription fee), this led to a discrete success of the console. Nintendo tried to encourage customers to buy its product reusing the legendary Wii brand, which many players knew very well at that time. </p>
        <p> However, a product is never succesful <b> only </b> for its technical merits, but needs <b> also </b> commercial support, and this was the problem with Wii-U. To understand it, we have to consider that main Wii-U competitors were PlayStation 4 and XBox One, which not only integrated a much superior hardware the Wii-U could not compete with, but also had (and still have) a stronger third party support from software houses. Wii-U instead wasn't loved as a development platform, and third party titles slowly diminished. These two aspects contributed to the slow death of the project. Nintendo decided to put a new effort in developing a completely new and different device, the Switch, and stopped Wii-U production in January 2017. </p>
