          <p id="intro"><i>Castlevania</i>, known in Japan as <i><b>Akumaj≈ç Dracula</b></i>
          (lit. "Devil's Castle Dracula") is the first game of the same series
          name. It's about a vampire hunter, who's name is Simon Belmont, who
          goes after the vampire Count Dracula, because of an old feud between
          Simon's ancestor and the vampire, with a whip brimming with holy power
          from his father.</p>

          <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
          <p>In 1591, Christopher Belmond, a vampire hunter, vanquished Count
          Dracula with the holy whip named Vampire Killer. The land of
          Transylvania enjoyed the victory and prospered for one hundred years.
          However, as it occurs every hundred years, the power of Jesus is
          weakened, so that's why, during the Easter celebration of 1691, the
          heart of men turned black as they yarned for chaos and destruction.
          For this reason, they sought to revive Count Dracula so he may spread
          chaos and ruination throughout the world, and they succeeded.
          </p>
          <p>Simon Belmont, the descendant of Christopher Belmont and present
          bearer of the Vampire Killer whip, came to knowledge that Count
          Dracula was revived and knew it was his duty to slay the vampire, even
          though it was known that Dracula grown in power with each
          resurrection. Simon proved himself a mighty vampire hunter by
          withstanding the monsters and traps of Dracula's castle, and in then,
          although thoroughly injured, was able to slay Count Dracula.</p>

          <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
          <h3 id="stages">Stages</h3>
          <p>
          <i>Castlevania</i> is an action platformer that emphasizes precision
          and timing. There are six linear stages with a boss at the end of
          each stage. Throughout the stages are present enemies that are
          typically taken from horror literature, lore and film. These try to
          take advantage of the environment, as their attacks usually inflicts
          knock back, they attempt to push Simon down pits and other traps, that
          cause instant defeat. As the player progresses further into the game,
          the enemies grow stronger and deal more damage, eventually to the
          point where they can defeat Simon in only four hits.</p>
          <p>Completing a stage rewards players point, the quicker the player
          clears the stage, the more points are earned. When a certain number is
          gained, the player gains extra lives.</p>

          <h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
          <p>Simon has multiple weapons at his disposition:
          <ol>
              <li>Vampire Killer (whip, main weapon);</li>
              <li>Boomerang (sub-weapon);</li>
              <li>Stopwatch (sub-weapon).</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <p>The whip deals damage over a shot distance in front of the character,
          both the strength and the length can be upgraded with items that can
          be found by striking candelabras or killing certain enemies.</p>
          <p>The boomerang is thrown straight ahead and crosses the length of
          the screen before returning to the point where it was thrown.</p>
          <p>The stopwatch halts enemy movement over a short period of time.</p>
          <p>Both sub-weapons cost hearts to use and only one can be carried at
          a time by Simon.</p>

          <h3 id="second_quest">Second Quest</h3>
          After beating the game, players return to the first stage while
          retaining their weapons and scores. They can attempt to complete the
          game once again but they will face stronger enemies.
