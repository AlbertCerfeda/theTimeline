              <p id="intro"><i>Castlevania</i>, known in Japan as <i><b>Akumaj≈ç Dracula</b></i>
              (lit. "Devil's Castle Dracula") is the first game of the same series
              name. It's about a <b>vampire hunter</b>, who's name is <b>Simon Belmont</b>, who
              goes after the vampire <b>Count Dracula</b>, because of an old feud between
              Simon's ancestor and the vampire, with a whip brimming with <b>holy power
              from his father</b>.</p>
              
              <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
              <p>In 1591, Christopher Belmond, a vampire hunter, vanquished Count
              Dracula with the holy whip named <b>Vampire Killer</b>. The land of
              <b>Transylvania</b> enjoyed the victory and prospered for one hundred years.
              However, as it occurs <b>every hundred years</b>, the power of Jesus is
              weakened, so that's why, during the Easter celebration of 1691, the
              heart of men turned black as they yarned for chaos and destruction.
              For this reason, they sought to <b>revive Count Dracula</b> so he may spread
              chaos and ruination throughout the world, and they succeeded.
              </p>

          <p>Simon Belmont, the descendant of Christopher Belmont and present
          bearer of the Vampire Killer whip, came to the knowledge that Count
          Dracula was revived and knew it was his duty to slay the vampire, even
          though it was known that <b>Dracula grew in power with each
          resurrection</b>. Simon proved himself a mighty vampire hunter by
          withstanding the monsters and traps of Dracula's castle, and in then,
          although thoroughly injured, was able to slay Count Dracula.</p>

              <h3 id="stages">Stages</h3>
              <p>
              <i>Castlevania</i> is an action platformer that emphasizes <b>precision</b>
              and <b>timing</b>. There are six linear stages with a boss at the end of
              each stage. Throughout the stages are present enemies that are
              typically taken from horror literature, lore, and film. These try to
              take advantage of the environment, as their attacks usually inflict
              <b>knockback</b>, they attempt to push Simon down <b>pits</b> and other traps, that
              cause <b>instant defeat</b>. As the player progresses further into the game,
              <b>the enemies grow stronger</b> and deal more damage, eventually to the
              point where they can defeat Simon in only four hits.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="img-container text-img">
              <img src="http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/71/89/ba/7189ba63dabbc68413892c4199530b05.jpg"
              alt="stage"/>
          </div>
          <p>Completing a stage rewards players point, the <b>quicker</b> the player
          clears the stage, the <b>more points</b> are earned. When a certain number is
          gained, the player <b>gains extra lives</b>.</p>

          </div>

          <h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
          <p>Simon has multiple weapons at his disposition:
          <ol>
              <li>Vampire Killer (whip, main weapon);</li>
              <li>Boomerang (sub-weapon);</li>
              <li>Stopwatch (sub-weapon).</li>
          </ol>
          </p>

          <p>The whip deals damage over a short distance in front of the
          character, both the <b>strength</b> and the <b>length</b> can be
          <b>upgraded</b> with items that can be found by striking candelabras
          or killing certain enemies.</p>

          <p>The boomerang is thrown straight ahead and <b>crosses the length of
          the screen</b> before returning to the point where it was thrown.</p>
          <p>The stopwatch <b>halts enemy movement</b> over a short period of time.</p>
          <p>Both sub-weapons <b>cost hearts</b> to use and <b>only one</b> can be carried at
          a time by Simon.</p>

          <h3 id="second_quest">Second Quest</h3>
          <p>After beating the game, players return to the first stage while
             retaining their weapons and scores. They can attempt to complete the
             game once again but they will face <b>stronger enemies</b>.</p>
