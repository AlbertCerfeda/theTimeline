        <p>
          <i>Pokémon Red Version</i> and <i>Pokémon Blue Version</i> are the first installments
          of the <i>Pokémon</i> video game series to be released outside of Japan (1998 for
          North America and 1999 for Europe). They are published by <i>Nintendo</i> and developed by <i>Game Freak</i>.
          Their Japanese versions were called <i>Pocket Monsters: Red</i> and <i>Pocket Monsters: Green</i>,
          and represent the true root of the franchise.
          <br>
          The games are supported by the Game Boy and an enhanced version for the same console,
          <i>Pokémon Yellow</i>, was released soon after. This version includes several changes and
          upgrades, while also following more closely the story of the homonymous
          animated TV series <i>Pokémon</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="s1.2">General Features</h3>
        <img style="float:right" src="media/pokemon_pallet.jpg" alt="Map of the starting city" width="300" height="300">

        <p>
          The games present similar features as other games from this generation. The player moves
          in a 2D scrolling scenery while keeping a third-person view and an overhead perspective.
          They are played on three main screens: the world in which the character moves; the battle
          screen; the menu interface. The main selling point of <i>Pokémon</i>, in general, is the
          concept of capturing creatures (called, unsurprisingly, Pokémons), training them, and
          battling other trainers.
          <br>
          <i>Pokémon Red Version</i> and <i>Pokémon Blue Version</i> had a huge success, becoming the best-selling
          non-bundled games for the Game Boy (despite being released towards the end of the console's lifespan).
          The games' release marked the beginning of what would become a pillar in the gaming
          industry and a multibillion-dollar franchise.

        <p>
          <i>Pokémon Red</i> and <i>Blue</i> present the usual traits of a Role-Playing-Game (RPG in short)
          but introduce a new level of depth. The main character isn't in fact the one fighting
          or jumping into action. This role is given to the (maximum) 6 monsters, called Pokémons,
          that you bring along your journey in this 2D-world. In these versions of the game, there
          are 151 available creatures, waiting only to be found. These companions can level up,
          learn new moves, evolve, and grow attached to you. Each Pokémon has determined stats that
          improve during the progression of the game. The battles introduce a complex system
          of damage calculation which gains additional depth by combining elemental weaknesses, defense and attack
          values, and also RNG (random number generator). The existence of all these factors allows
          a pretty much infinite replayability, making the game feel always new. Another great
          addition is the possibility to communicate between consoles using a cable
          (<i>link cable</i>), which allows us to trade Pokémons with other players.
        </p>

        <h3 id="s2.2">The exemplar Plot</h3>
        <p>
          The story, setting, and progression of these first versions of the game set the standard
          for all future versions to come. <i>Pokémon Red Version</i> and <i>Pokémon Blue Version</i>
          take place in the region of Kanto, an actual region in Japan, and the layout of the cities
          and roads pushes the player to progress following a certain path. The player begins in their
          hometown, Pallet Town. Through interaction with many NPCs (non-playable characters), the
          objective of our travels becomes clear: beat all 8 gyms (which can be considered local bosses)
          and eventually beat the <i>elite 4</i> (the four strongest trainers of the region) to then become champion.
