          <b>Bertie the Brain</b> is a computer game, and one of the first games developed. Josef Kates built it for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. 
         </p>
         <p>
           The four-meter tall computer enabled the exhibition visitors to play a game of tic-tac-toe against artificial intelligence. Bertie the Brain was developed essentially as a marketing tool. Josef Kates intended to present his invention, the Additron tube, to engineers at the Canadian National Exhibition. The Additron tube is a computer component.

        <h2 id="s2">History</h2>
          <p>
            The designer Josef Kates had worked designing and building radar tubes during World War II. He was also involved in building the University of Toronto Electronic Computer, one of the world's first working computers. 
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, Josef Kates designed a miniature version of the vacuum tube, called the Additron tube.<br>
            The Additron tube had huge potential. So much so that after registering for a license for the Additron tube, Josef Kates decided to create a device proving that.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="media/additron_tube_schematic.png" alt="Additron tube" width="60%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <figcaption>Schematic representation of the Additron tube</figcaption>
          </figure>
           <p>
            This device was also known as Bertie the Brain, which was developed for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition, and its purpose was to showcase the tube to potential buyers.   
          </p>
          <p>
            The four-meter tall computer could play tic-tac-toe, and it was a success at the two-week exhibition. The visitors lined up to play it.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the exhibition, Josef Kates dismantled the computer, and its original workings have been lost.
          </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="s3">Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
          Bertie the Brain was the classic tic-tac-toe game. The player could select the next move from a grid of nine illuminated buttons. 
          </p>
          <figure>
              <img src="media/bertie_the_brain.gif" alt="tic-tac-toe game" width="40%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
              <figcaption>Tic-Tac-Toe game</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The selected moves would then appear on the nine large squares grid, with either an X- or O-shaped light in their corresponding space. <br>
            The computer would then execute its move quickly after. Signs to the playfield's right alternately lit up, signaling which player's turn it was. The computer responded nearly instantly to the player's moves. <br>
            It would also signal simultaneously with <b>Win</b> when a player had triumphed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Bertie the Brain, was able to be set to various difficulty levels. It was designed to be unbeatable at the highest difficulty level.
