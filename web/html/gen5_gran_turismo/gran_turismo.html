        <p>
          Gran Turismo is a sim racing video game designed by Kazunori Yamauchi. Gran Turismo was developed by Polys Entertainment and published by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1997 for the PlayStation video game console. The game's development group was later established as Polyphony Digital. <br/>
          After five years of development time, it was well-received publicly and critically, shipping a total of 10.85 million copies worldwide as of March 2013 (making it the best-selling PlayStation game), and scoring an average of 95% in GameRankings' aggregate, making it the highest rated racing video game of all-time. <br/>
          Many publications have deemed it one of the greatest video games of all time. The game has started a series, and has spawned over 10 spin-offs and sequels.

        <h2 id="s2">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          Gran Turismo is a racing game. The player must maneuver a car to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode. <br/>In the Arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. <br/>Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.
          However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits (money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Credits can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning.
        </p>
        <h2 id="s3">Reception</h2>
        <p>
          Gran Turismo received widespread acclaim from critics and consumers alike, with praise for its graphics, soundtrack, tight controls and amount of cars. It was classified as "universal acclaim", according to review aggregator Metacritic.<br/>
          Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that "as it stands in the Japanese version, everything about Gran Turismo is a class act, and it raises the bar for racing games on almost every possible level. Our highest possible recommendation".<br/>
          Gran Turismo won the best simulation of 1999 at the Spotlight Awards, won "Best Driving Game" and "Best Graphics" of 1999 according to the staff of PlayStation Official Magazine, and was voted the sixth best game of all time by the magazine's readers in the same issue. In 2000, readers of Computer and Video Games voted it the eighth best video game of all time.
