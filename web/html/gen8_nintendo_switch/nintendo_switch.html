        <h2 id="s1"> Introduction </h2>
        <p> The last 8th generation consoles we will cover is the Switch, released by Nintendo in march 2017. Due to its peculiar nature, this console is not intended to succeed any previous model, although it became the actual successor of Wii-U after its discontinuation. Like Wii-U, this is a revolutionary console, with many aspects that its competitors never implemented. </p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h2 id="s2"> The hardware </h2>
        <p> The Nintendo Switch is an hybrid and modular device, divided in three parts: the actual console unit is a portable gaming device with a 6 inch touch screen and a rechargeable battery. It could be attached to a docking station, named "dock" with HDMI port and other connectivity, to transform it in a stationary console. Finally, the two joysticks, named "joy-con" can be coupled togeter with a grip and use them like a gamepad, when the console is stationary; otherwise, it's possible to attach them to the console unit and use them in portable mode. </p>
        <p> The console unit is the core of the system. It's based on a NVIDIA Tegra X1 SoC, with 8 Arm cores running up to 2 GHz, and a Nvidia Maxwell GPU. </p>
        <p> This is a chip intended to give relatively high performance with low power consumption: the perfect combination for a device like the Switch. </p>
        <p> The Switch integrates 4 GB of LPDDR3 ram, a reasonable quantity for a mobile device, and integrates 32 GB of internal flash memory. Using micro-sd cards is possible to extend the memory capability. </p>
        <p> While in portable mode, the battery allows for about 4 hours of gaming. Later revisions of the Switch, which incorporated the NVidia Tegra X1+ SoC, a more efficient version of the X1, lasted one more hour. </p>
        <p> While connected to the stand, the Switch supports HDMI video output to a TV up to Full HD. </p>

        <h2 id="s3"> Input devices </h2>
        <p> The joy-cons are simple joysticks that can be use to interact with the Switch. While in stationary mode, they can be attached one to the other with a bundled grip to create a sort of gamepad. This particular approach is due to the hybrid nature of the console. In fact, when the console is detached from the dock, the joy-cons can be attached to the left and right sides of the console unit to add physical controls. This is the only console that implements this modular and flexible approach. </p>
        <p> For hardcore gamers or people who want a more traditional experience, there is also the Nintendo Switch Pro gamepad, which is a traditional not modular gamepad that can be used with the Switch. </p>

        <h2 id="s4"> Software and capabilities </h2>
        <p> The Nintendo Switch runs a proprietary operating system optimized for gaming. In fact, this is the only 8th generation console to drop (at least by default) any multimedia feature, being designed primarily for gaming. This is a precise choice in order to create a simple, easy to use device. </p>
        <p> The multitasking capabilities, found in the Wii-U, are gone too. Only a single screen can be used, either the integrated one or the external one, but not both simultaneously. This is the exactly opposite approach to Wii-U dual screen features. </p>
        <p> However the online integration is still there. With the Nintendo account it's possible to access the Nintendo Eshop to buy digital content, such as games and additional apps, and to play multiplayer games. </p>
        <p> Data can be stored inside the main memory or on a Micro-Sd card. Specific data types, such as game saves, are always stored in the interal memory. However, moving data between the various media is possible after a firmware update. </p>
        <p> The Switch is also compatible with games from older consoles, such as Nintendo Ds, GameBoy, Nintendo 64 and so on. They are downloadable via the Nintendo Eshop. </p>

        <h2 id="s5"> Market reception </h2>
        <p> From this description it's evident that the Nintendo Switch doesn't compete directly with PS4 and Xbox One. Nintendo tried to enter in this battle with the Wii-U and failed, so they chose a different approach: create an innovative product, that cannot be compared to anything else on the market, avoiding a risky competition with other consoles with more powerful hardware and better suited for other tasks. </p>
        <p> This strategy gave big results: in fact, the Nintendo Switch is the most succesful console Nintendo ever made, second only to the original Wii. </p>
