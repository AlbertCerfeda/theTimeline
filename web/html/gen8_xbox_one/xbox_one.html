        <h2 id="s1"> Introduction </h2>
        <p> The fourth 8th generation console to be launched was the Xbox One, manufactured by Microsoft and released in November 2013, almost simultaneously to the PlayStation 4, its main competitor. Intended as a successor of the Xbox 360, its name derives from "all-in-one device", which is the concept behind the console: an all-in-one gaming and multimedia device to place in a living room. With improved hardware and gamepad, Windows-like experience and new features, the console rapidly became the second most successful console of the 8th generation, behind the PS4. </p>

        <h2 id="s2"> The hardware </h2>
        <p> Similarly to the PS4, Xbox One drops the IBM PowerPC compatible Xenon CPU in favour of an AMD x86 CPU. The SoC contains 8 AMD Jaguar cores running at 1.75 GHz. </p>
        <p> The same advantages described for PS4 can be found here: developing games for the Xbox and PC requires much less effort, due to their architecture similarities. Backward compatibility, instead, can theoretically be a big issue. </p>
        <p> The SoC integrates a graphics processor from AMD, based on their GCN architecture. It could deliver 1.3 TFlops of compute power, 0.5 TFlops less than the PS4. </p>
        <p> The device integrates 8 GB of DDR3 memory, with 3 GB reserved to the system software and the rest 5 GB shared by CPU and GPU. To compensate the lower performance of DDR3 compared to GDDR5, Xbox One integrates also 32 MB of very fast embedded static ram (eSram) memory, which can help in increasing the memory throughput. </p>
        <p> Storage is based on non-replaceable hard drives. There are variant with 500 GB, 1 TB and limited 2 TB drives. Storage can be expanded with USB external media. The optical drive support CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disks. </p>
        <p> The console supports wifi, bluetooth and ethernet for communication and as USB ports and HDMI output. Interestingly enough, Xbox One has also a HDMI input, to passthrough devices with a video output, like TV boxes. </p>

        <h2 id="s3"> Input devices </h2>
        <p> The Xbox One game pad is based on its predecessor, however it implements new features, such as a smoother form, textured analog sticks, a four wai directional pad, and redesigned triggers (which now can vibrate independently) and buttons for increased ease of use and confort. The trigger vibration can be used as a second feedback, for example to send information about directions of enemies. The light bar is used by the Kinect sensor to track its movement. </p>
        <p> A revisited controller was released in 2015, with a 3.5 mm headset jack. A third revision was released in 2016, with Xbox OneS, supporting Bluetooth. </p>
        <p> The controller can be charged via USB. WIth this interface, its possible to connect the controller to PCs running Windows 7 or above and use it for PC gaming. There is also a wireless adapter that permits to use the controller remotely with a PC. </p>
        <p> The console supports also the classic Kinect motion sensor device, which is now improved. </p>

        <h2 id="s4"> Software and capabilities </h2>
        <p> The console runs two independent operating systems controlled by an hypervisor (similar to virtual machines), one for gaming, the other one for apps and multimedia. The system software is basically a reduced version of Windows (initially Windows 8, from 2015 Windows 10). The machine can run Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, like Windows 10, and so a developer can easily port its app from PC to the console. </p>
        <p> The first user interface was derived from the Metro UI of Windows 8. Later revisions were based on Microsoft's Fluent Design. Voice control is present and requires Kinect to be connected. Microsoft Cortana is also present. </p>
        <p> Xbox One <b> requires </b> an internet connection to work properly. In fact, after 24 hours in offline mode, the user must connect it to Internet to use it. </p>
        <p> Xbox One is compatible with Xbox Live services, which permits to play multiplayer games and buy digital content. This service is now integrated also in Windows 10. </p>
        <p> In fact, it's possible to stream games on Windows based devices and mobile iOs and Android ones, with the Xbox app and Xbox smart glass app, respectively, and playing remotely on these devices. </p>
        <p> The console is also compatible with Oculus Rift VR headset: enabled titles can be played in virtual reality with this technology. </p>
        <p> The console can be used also as a home media center. You can play Cds, DVDs and Blu-ray content and files on external media via the Media player app. It's possible to connect a TV box to output TV media on the monitor Xbox is attached at. A Microsoft service, called OneGuide, let users watch selected TV channels directly via Xbox. </p>
        <p> Compatibility wise, the console is backward compatible with selected Xbox 360 and Xbox titles via emulation. </p>

        <h2 id="s5"> Derivatives </h2>
        <p> In 2016, Xbox OneS appeared on the market. This was a slimmer Xbox One with a new controller bundled with. Performance wise, almost nothing changed, but the GPU was slightly overclocked. </p>
        <p> In 2019, Microsoft launched a Xbox OneS all-digital edition, without the optical drive. This edition was extremely succesful and let Microsoft gain over Sony in terms of sales. </p>
        <p> In 2017, Microsoft released the Xbox OneX (codenamed "Project Scorpio"), to compete with Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro. It has a completely new SoC, with a new AMD GPU capable of 6 TFlops of power and 4K gaming, and also a new processor, based on a modified Jaguar microarchitecture (and not the more powerful AMD Zen architecture as expected). Also Ram was improved: 12 GB of GDDR5 were implemented, solving one of the most negative aspects of the device. This console let gamers play games at 4K resolution with higher performance than PS4 Pro does. Also this console was a big success. </p>

        <h2> id="s6"> Market reception </h2>
        <p> The mandatory internet connection was one of the most discussed thing about Xbox before its launch. Due to this limitation, many people were discouraged and didn't buy the Microsoft console. The other disadvantage of Xbox One compared to PS4 was performance: with its more powerful GPU and its much faster ram, graphics performance and quality was unreachable for Xbox One. This reflected on the sales of the console, which stayed at the second place, behind PS4, for long time. </p>
        <p> Things changed with the arrival of Xbox OneS and Xbox OneX. While the first one was only a slimmer Xbox One, the second was a strong competitor of the PS4 Pro. Microsoft solved all performance issues of the original Xbox One and integrated a clearly superior hardware, compared to the PS4 Pro. Thus, the two later revisions gained much more popularity than the original one. </p>
