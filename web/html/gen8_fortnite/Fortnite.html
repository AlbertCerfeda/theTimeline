        <p>
          One day, 98% of Earth's human population suddenly disappeared, and the remaining humans found the skies covered in dense clouds, creating chaotic storms that dropped husks:
          humanoid zombie-like creatures that attacked the living. The survivors found ways to construct "storm shields", a field that cleared the storm clouds from immediately
           overhead and reduced the attacks from husks, and used these to set up survivor bases across the globe. The player is a commander of one of these bases, charged with finding
           a way to return Earth to its normal state
        </p>

        <h3 id="s3.2">Multiplayer</h3>
        <p>
          The main gameplay for Fortnite Battle Royale follows the standard format for the battle royale genre, with up to 100 players participating each round.
          Fortnite Battle Royale's primary distinction from other battle royale games is the building system, which originated from the original Fortnite survival game.
          Nearly all objects in the environment can be destroyed and harvested for materials which can then be used to build fortifications of limited durabilities, such as walls, ramps, floors, and roofs,
          which can be used to help traverse the map or to fight other  players.

        <h2 id="s4">Development</h2>
        <p>
          Fortnite began from an internal game jam at Epic Games . Though it was not initially one of the developed titles during the jam, the concept of merging the construction game genre, representing games
          like Minecraft and Terraria, and shooter games arose, leading to the foundation of Fortnite.Further, Epic was looking to get into the games as a service model, and brought in Chinese publisher
          Tencent to help. With the release of Fortnite Battle Royale, the player-versus-environment mode was distinguished as "Save the World". Ultimately, Epic opted to release Save the World as a premium title,
          bringing it out of early access on June 29, 2020.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="s5">Impact</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Fortnite Battle Royale became a significant financial success for Epic Games. Within two weeks of release, over 10 million players had played the mode, and by June 2018, just after the Nintendo Switch
          release, had reached 125 million players. Fortnite Battle Royale has also become a cultural online phenomenon, with several celebrities reporting they play the game, and athletes using Fortnite emotes
          as victory celebrations. A notable streaming event in March 2018, with streamer Ninja playing Fortnite Battle Royale alongside Drake, Travis Scott and other celebrities, broke viewership records for Twitch
          to date. Epic Games has developed organized esports competitions around Fortnite Battle Royale, such as the inaugural US$30 million Fortnite World Cup tournament that took place in July 2019.
