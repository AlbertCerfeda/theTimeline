        <h3 id="s1.1"><u>General information</u></h3>
        <p>
          The game represents the sixth part of the <i>Call of Duty series</i> and the direct sequel to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
          which takes place five years later in 2016. The capital expenditures were around $ 200 million, according to the LA
          Times, of which <b>$40 to 50 million</b> was spent on game development and the remainder on sales, marketing, and public
          relations.
          In March 2020 a remaster of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 and announced for <b>Windows</b> and <b>Xbox One</b>
          for April 30, 2020.
          The game uses the “IW 4.0” engine developed by Infinity Ward, which is a further development of the “IW Engine”
          used in <b>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</b>. <br>
          Although Infinity Ward relies less on opulent graphics compared to studios such as <b>Epic Games</b> or <b>Crytek</b>, the engine looks <b>contemporary</b> and has the advantage for the player that the hardware
          requirements are kept lower compared to games like Crysis. Among other things, the particle effects have been
          improved, and <b>the character and weapon models have been upgraded compared to their predecessor</b>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="s1.2"><u>Players</u></h3>
        <p>
        During the single-player campaign, the player controls five different characters from a first-person perspective.
        The player primarily controls Sergeant Gary "Roach" Sanderson, a British member of an international Special Forces unit named Task Force 141.
        In addition to Roach, the player will also assume control of Private First Class <b>Joseph Allen</b> (Troy Baker) and <b>Private James Ramirez</b> of the US Army 75th Ranger Regiment.<br>
        The now <b>Captain John "Soap" MacTavish</b> (Kevin McKidd) serves as a senior member of <b>Task Force 141</b>, acting as Roach's superior officer and becomes the playable character in the final three missions of the game.<br>
        Lastly, the player briefly assumes the role of an astronaut stationed on the <b>International Space Station</b> during the height of the war between the <b>United States</b> and <b>Russia</b>.
