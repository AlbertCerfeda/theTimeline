Space Invaders is an arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado. 
Tomohiro Nishikado, spent a year designing the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it.

Microcomputers in Japan were not powerful enough at the time to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, so Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using the latest microprocessors from the United States.


Space Invaders was a worldwide success and paved the way for a generation of shooting games that became extremely popular. In Japan demand for the arcade game was so great that it led to a coin shortage and prompted an increase in production of the 100-yen coin. In 1980 American game manufacturer Atari, Inc., adapted a version of the game for the Atari 2600 console, fueling the popularity of home gaming. 


In the first few months following its release in Japan, Space Invaders became popular.Specialty arcades opened with nothing but Space Invaders cabinets,and by the end of 1978 Taito had installed over 100,000 machines and grossed over US$600 million in Japan alone. By 1980, Taito had sold over 300,000 Space Invaders arcade machines in Japan,and 60,000 machines in the United States within one year,where prices ranged from $2000 to $3000 for each machine.
