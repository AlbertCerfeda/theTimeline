          In 1952, University of Cambridge student Alexander Sandy Douglas was working towards earning his Ph.D. His thesis focused on human-computer interactions and he needed an example to prove his theories. At that time Cambridge was home to the very first stored-program computer, the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). This gave Douglas the perfect opportunity to prove his findings by programming the code for a simple game where a player can compete against the computer.
Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) was an early (1949) vacuum tubes (it contained 3000 tubes) based British computer, operating 600 instructions per second. It used 32 mercury delay lines (orÂ long tanks) each of which stored 32 words of 18 bits. Hence the total memory capacity of the EDSAC was the equivalent of about 2 kilobytes. A useful feature of this serial memory technology was that it was possible to display the contents of the store on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors. Each tank stored 16 words of 35 bits. EDSAC used 3 CRTs, one of which displayed the contents of one of the long tanks. Thus, the display was a matrix of 35 x 16 dots.
The input of EDSAC was via five-hole punched tape (thus the actual program for the OXO game was punched on a strip of paper ) and output was via a teleprinter or CRT.
The graphics of OXO, consisted of large dots forming the cross hatches of the playing field as well as the "O" and "X" player graphics.
Each game was played against an artificially intelligent opponent (EDSAC) as the "O" and the player as the "X"; EDSAC determined who played first (EDSAC or USER).
Moves were made by the player selecting which square to occupy with an "X" by dialing its corresponding number via the EDSAC's telephone dial. The telephone dial was used as a keyboard to input numbers and directions into the computer.
The text output of the OXO game was something like:
Douglas' project was a success earning him his Ph.D. and starting his career in science, however, he would never again program another video or computer game.
OXO  became the very first video game and graphical computer game, but it was also one of the very first (albeit primitive) applications of true artificial intelligence. The computer's moves in reaction to the player move were not random or pre-determined but entirely made at the computer's discretion. OXO is often overlooked for its accomplishments in artificial intelligence as the study of AI didn't become a valid science until 1958 when scientist John McCarthy coined the term.
Although OXO was the very first video/computer game, it was almost completely overlooked at the time also because there was only one EDSAC computer in existence, which was housed at the University of Cambridge and never made accessible to the public.
The code for OXO was retained as a tech demo for the EDSAC's capabilities.4-
