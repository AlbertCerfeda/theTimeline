        <h2 id="s1"> Introduction </h2>
        <p> PlayStation 5 and the full lineup of Microsoft's Xbox consoles are slowly going on sale precisely in these days (november 2020). talking about them, their performance and their potential success is a risky and quite wrong thing to do. We are going to talk briefly about them, describing the trends they're following. </p>
        
        <h2 id="s2"> The hardware/gaming trend </h2>
        <p> Every generation of gaming consoles brought improvements on many aspects, including graphics capabilities and gaming performance alongside new features, so this expectations are legitimate also for the 9th generation of consoles. However, technological improvements in last years were much more impressive than in the years of the transition from the 7th generation to the 8th generation. </p>
        <p> Speaking of gaming, this trend is reflected in the impressive increase in screen resolution and in the birth of new technologies, such as aughmented / virtual reality, ray tracing and high refresh rate monitors, technologies that are at this time implemented only on PCs, This had been possible because PC performance increased dramatically, with multi-core CPUs and extremely powerful GPUs which performance grows at an impressive speed. Even storage architecture is changing, with the hard drives being replaced by solid state drives (SSD), which do not use the traditional Sata interface anymore, but connect directly to the CPU with extremely fast PCI Express lanes and the NVM express protocol. Considering the similarities between PC architecture and 8th generation consoles, the comparison is mandatory, and the improvement on the consoles must be the same. </p>
        <p> With 9th generation consoles, the flagship graphics standard will be 8K. They will implement modern processors based on the most performing architectures, such as AMD Zen 2, with on-par performance with PCs. On the GPU side, AMD Radeon DNA2 (RDNA2) architecture will drive gaming performance and graphics beauty. And finally, the consoles will implement NVME based SSDs, replacing the ancient hard disk drive. </p>
        
        <h2 id="s3"> The Software trend </h2>
        <p> In last years, the main goal of software based companies like Microsoft and Google can be resumed in few concepts: always connected and sincronized, cloud based and integrated with online services. There are too many reasons for this and this is not the right website to analyze them. Let's discuss only one aspect: with this approach, companies can do data collecting, and user data  are much more profitable than we can imagine. </p>
        <p> Starting from the 8th generation, consoles began to integrate social network apps, online services and sincronization with multiple devices via online accounts. Microsoft is the best example in this respect: with the Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft created a software that can be executed by a multitude of completely different devices, from tablets to PCs to IoT devices and also consoles. The Xbox one was a perfect bridge between the user and this ecosystem. </p>
        <p> Newer consoles, such as the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox series X / series S family, are going to implement this strategy in an even more aggressive way. Just to do an example, the Xbox initial setup can be done via the Xbox app on the smartphone, and Microsoft encourages the user to do so. In this way, users will sincronize their datas between devices with an online account, which means data collecting. </p>
        <p> This will be the trend, speaking of software and services. A bit sad about our privacy and the privacy of gamers, but we have to live with it. </p>
