          Donkey Kong is a platform arcade video game developed and produced by Nintendo and released in 1981. It was later converted for many types of computers and consoles, as well as Game & Watch. Famous characters Mario - here called Jumpman - and Donkey Kong appear for the first time.

          So what's the game about?  <br>
          Each level consists mainly of platforms with the appearance of metal beams and ladders. The player can jump to avoid the lethal objects that run across the platforms. 
          In each screen Jumpman (or Mario) can only use each of the hammers present once to destroy obstacles (except the springs and Donkey Kong). 
          Once a hammer is picked up, Jumpman automatically and continuously uses it to strike in front of him for a short amount of time, however he cannot climb stairs or jump while the hammer is in hand.
          THe game has 4 different levels:
          <ol>
            <li>Level 1 - Jumpman must be able to climb a crumbling scaffolding, with slightly inclined platforms, while avoiding being hit by the barrels thrown by Donkey. </li>
            <li>Level 2 - Jumpman has to climb a structure consisting largely of conveyor belts. The main obstacles in this level are the flames that are all over around.</li>
            <li>Level 3 - Jumpman has to go up and down via some elevators, all this while avoiding the flames and bouncing springs. </li>
            <li>Level 4 - It is the final level; the flames remain once again the main obstacle. Jumpman must remove the eight "keystones" that support the floor on which Donkey Kong is.</li>
          </ol>  
          The levels become progressively more and more difficult thanks to some small variations such as more unpredictable trajectories for barrels and springs, or faster flames.        </p>
        <p></p>
