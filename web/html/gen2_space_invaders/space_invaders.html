          Space Invaders is an arcade game created by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978 by Taito corp. <br>
          It took one year for Tomohiro Nishikado to design the game and build up the necessary hardware. By the fact that microcomputers were not powerful enough in Japan, Nishikado had to do his own costomization on the hardware and for the development tools. To do so he used the latest microprocessors from the United States. </p>

          So what's the game about?  <br>
          Space Invaders is a fixed shooter game where the player controls a laser weapon by moving it to the left or the right in the lower part of the screen firing the descending aliens.  The goal is to "kill" rows of aliens that move horizontally as they advance toward the bottom. 

          The player's laser gun is protected by some fixed shields.  These shields can be destroyed by the aliens or, by mistake, by the player.  
        </p>

        <h2 id="s2">Success</h2>
        <h3 id="s2.1">Market Impact</h3>
        The game was a success worlwide, especially in Japan.  <br>
        In fact, just in Japan, 100'000 machines were installed by the end of 1978 with a profit of 600 milion dollars. Although its graphics are considered very primitive by today's standards, Space Invaders has had a huge impact on society and the video game industry itself. Before the release of Space Invaders, arcade machines were mainly pinball machines: when Taito released the game, no one had ever seen anything like it before. In the early days, the players queued for hours waiting for their turn.  
        The game was so popular in Japan to the point that it caused a 100-yen deficiency and it was necessary to increase the production of the coin.
