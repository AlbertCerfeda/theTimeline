        <p>
          <b>Tennis for Two</b>, also called <b>Computer Tennis<b>, is one of the first games developed in the video games' early history.
            <!--in the early history of video games.--> It was designed by American physicist Willian Higinbotham in 1958 and displayed at the
          Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition. It simulates a virtual game of tennis, using
          the Donner Model 30 analog computer's ability to simulate wind resistance trajectories. <!--trajectories with wind resistance.-->

        <p>
        The game was displayed on an oscilloscope and controlled with two custom aluminum controllers. The visuals
        represent a tennis court as if it's viewed from the side, and the knobs on the controllers are used to adjust
        the angle of the shots so players can hit the ball over the net by pressing the button. The ball is represented
        as a point of light, the tennis court as a horizontal line, and the net as a short vertical line. The ball
        can either hit the net, the other side of the court, or fly out of bounds, as well as bounce on the ground.
        </p>

        Further versions of the game were developed due to how popular it became. Some of them were a bigger screen,
        as well as different levels of simulated gravity. It enabled players to play tennis as if they were on the
        Moon or Jupiter.

        <h2 id="s3">Legacy</h2>
        <p>
        After its disassembly in 1959, <!--the game-->Tennis for Two was largely forgotten, other than being mentioned in a
        court case and some articles in 1982 and 1983 where its potential status as the first video game was highlighted.
        Higinbotham himself declined that claim, saying that the game was an extension of the bouncing ball program for
        the Donner Model 30 and not worthy of patenting. The 50th anniversary of Brookhaven featured a recreation of the
        game, which took 3 months to construct due to the parts' unavailability.<!--unavailability of the parts.--> It was displayed in 1997 and 2008
        for the anniversary of the actual game but implemented an analog computerusing solid-state operational amplifier
         devices instead of vacuum tubes as the original Donner Model 30 did.
