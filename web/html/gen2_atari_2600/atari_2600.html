        <h3 id="s1.0">A bit of History</h3>
        <p>
            The Atari Video Computer System (VCS), later called the Atari 2600, is considered the equal console to become
            globally popular. This console revolutionized the entire gaming industry of the seventies and made videogames
            a very popular product, the Atari 2600 entered the market on September 11, 1977 (nowadays a not too lucky yearbook)
            and remained in production until 1992, becoming one of the longest-lived and best-selling consoles in history.
            Features of the machine are its basic graphics, an elegant and very 70ies-style chassis and the controller with only
            one joystick, not very comfortable;
            Atari 2600 was in fact initially designed for very simple games like PONG and Space Invaders, but was
            finally used for the most disparate gaming concepts.
        </p>
        <h3 id="s1.1">The Hardware</h3>
        <p>
            The Atari 2600 hardware design experienced many revisions during its production history.
            The main parts were although these:
        <ul>
            <li>CPU: 1.19 MHz MOS Technology 6507</li>
            <li>Audio + Video processor: Television Interface Adaptor</li>
            <li>RAM: 128 bytes (more could be added in the game cartridges)</li>
            <li>ROM(game cartridges): 4kB maximum capacity</li>
            <li>Input: two controller ports, six switches (Power, TV signal etc)</li>
            <li>Output: TV picture and sound signal through RF modulator</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="s1.2">The Controller</h3>

            The stick controller CX40 of the Atari 2600 is known everywhere because of its particular shape, nowadays not
            really inviting for gamers. This controller allowed input in four directions. An interesting fact is that
            unlike today's controllers, the Atari 2600 controller was digital, in the sense that pushing the stick in
            one direction completed a certain circuit, sending an electrical signal to the console. This controller
            was also designed to rest on a stand and not to be gripped like modern joysticks.
            With success came new games, and with new games came new controllers: the CX50 Keyboard Controller was
            introduced in June 1978 and the simpler CX23 controller for kids was released a few later.

            Street Racer, Surround and Video Olympics. Since all the games of this console can't be presented here,

        <h2 id="s3">Impact on the Market and Reception</h2>
        <p>
            As said before, <b>this console is a real milestone</b> in Video games history can boast a huge success all over the world.
            This came after a few years of his introduction on the market; in fact, initially the console sold well but was
            not very successful because the video game market had not yet exploded. The real success came in 1979 when the console
            started to record numbers, thanks to the release of conversions of famous arcade games for which Atari had acquired the rights, including Space Invaders, which pushed the sales of the console
            making it a great commercial success. Between the late seventies and early eighties Atari 2600 dominated the console market allowing Atari
            to record sales of $5 billion at the end of 1982.
        </p>
        <h3 id="s3.1">Competition</h3>
        <p>
            Atari's new console was presented on September 11, 1977, initially under the name Video Computer System (VCS).
            Because of this Fairchild changed the name of its ESR in <a href="../gen2_fairchild_channel_f/fairchild_channel_f.html">Channel F</a> to avoid ambiguity.
            During 1982 another console, the ColecoVision by Coleco, made its debut and started a fierce competition. Despite its outdated hardware,
            Atari 2600 was able to withstand the competition thanks to the hundreds of titles released and the popularity gained in previous years.
