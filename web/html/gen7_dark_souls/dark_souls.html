        <h2 id="s1">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Dark Souls is an ARPG (action role-playing-game) developed by FromSoftware and published by
          Namco Bandai Games on September 22, 2011 for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Later, in 2012, it
          would also receive a PC release. The game is for all intents and purposes the child of lead director
          Hidetaka Miyazaki whose vision and artistic genius in the <i>Souls</i> series have been endlessly lauded.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="s2">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          The game is played in third-person and players are encouraged to explore the world. The game is
          known for its punishing gameplay: both proficiency at mechanics of the game as well as the lack of
          knowledge of the game world can lead to death. And in this game death truly is punishing; one loses
          their “souls” which can be used to level up, meaning that one effectively loses potential levels. When
          a game is deemed souls-like it usually refers to the combat system being similar to Dark Souls; the reason
          being that its combat system is very rewarding. It is very interactive, requiring the player to dodge,
          roll and attack to be able to kill the opponent.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="s3">Success</h2>
        <p>
          Upon its release Dark Souls immediately became a cult classic, having both successes domestically in
          Japan as well as in the west. It was received well by most critics, the only criticisms being the
          difficulty of the game, and after years had gone by it would be hailed as one of the best games of all
          time. Due to its success the game would later receive two sequels which have only built upon the initial
          success, creating genuinely great games. It has given rise to many imitators who seek to replicate the
          atmosphere and combat of the game, some of whom have come quite close.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="s4">Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Dark souls can be considered as one of the most influential games of its generation, having left a
          legacy that few would be able to match and still continuing to inspire game creators to this day, such
          as those of: The Surge, The Witcher, God of War, and Destiny. The game is often considered to be to
          difficult, however this is the reason for its success; the satisfaction of overcoming the struggle of
          beating enemies in the game is what keeps players coming back. This as well as other elements of its
          design philosophy have truly come to influence the way games are thought of.
