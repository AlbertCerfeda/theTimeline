          The game has no plot: the protagonist has to take the jobs the boss gives him and complete them paying attention to the police.

          Grand Theft Auto is made up of six levels split between three main cities: Liberty City, Vice City and San Andreas, with completing a level unlocking the next one in the chain. Players can choose a character and name them, but this choice brings no difference to the gameplay. In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a target number of points from a \$1,000,000 start, amd they can be gained from anything, but the most typical means is takig a job from the local mafia. Jobs can be taken by interacting with a ringing telephone box.
          Job completion does not have a strict order, but failing to complete a job (by dying or being arrested or other events) can heavily affect the game, since the player gets no points and cannot unlock more rewarding missions. Players can find equipment across the level's map to help them with jobs and making points, including weapons and body armour. If the player is killed (referred to in the game as "Wasted"), they lose a life and all their current equipment and all their bonuses get reset; losing all their lives will result in a compulsory restart. Law enforcement is present in each level, and doing criminal actions will cause the player to raise their notoriety with police; the higher the level, the tougher the response. If the player is arrested, they forfeit all equipment, and lose half of the bonuses.
