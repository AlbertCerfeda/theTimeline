          The game has no plot: the protagonist has to take the jobs the boss gives him and complete them paying attention to the police.

          Grand Theft Auto is made of six levels divided between three cities: Liberty City, Vice City and San Andreas: completing a level unlocks the next one in a chain structure.
          Players can choose a character and name them, but this choice brings no difference to the gameplay.<br><br>
          In each level, the players' goal is to reach a certain amount of dollars starting from a base budget of $1,000,000; money can be gained from anything, but the easiest and most classical way is working for the local mafia. To accept a job, the player must interact with a ringing telephone box.<br><br>

          There is no fixed order to complete jobs with, but failing to complete a job (by dying or being arrested or other events) can heavily affect the game, since the player gets no points and cannot unlock more rewarding missions.<br><br> Equipment can be found across the levels, and it can be used to help with jobs and gain money (weapons and armour fit in the category as well). If the player is killed (or, in the game language, gets "wasted"), they lose a life and all their current equipment and all their bonuses get reset; losing all their lives will result in a compulsory restart.<br><br>

          <br>Players must be careful to law enforcement, and criminal actions will cause them to be known to the police, and their response to the player's action become stricter every level. If the player is arrested, they lose all equipment and half of the bonuses.<br><br>
