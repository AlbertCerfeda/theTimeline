        <p>
        The Persicope is an electromechanical shooting gallery arcade game developed by two different companies:
        <ul>
          <li>Sega Enterprices</li>
          <li>Nakamura Manufacturing Co (Namco)</li>
        </ul>
        Nakamura claims the Persicope as their first arcade game, launching as early as 1965 in Japan, while Sega's version launched
        in 1966. The arcade machine popularized the 25 cents cost per play in the USA and lead to development of 8 to 10 new arcade
        games by Sega each year, for the next few years. The original release by Sega consisted of a three-player cabinet with a cost
        per play of 30 Japanese Yen. It was later demonstrated alongside slot machines, slot racing games, and pinball games at the
        23rd London Amusement Trades Exhibition show in December 1966.

        A smaller single-player cabinet was distributed internationally, though it was still larger in dimensions than most games of the
        time. Japan's high export tax made the machine very expensive, costing around 1295$ per unit.
        <h2 id="s2">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
        The arcade machine contains a shooting gallery game, which simulates a battle between a submarine and warships, the background of the game
        is an ocean, and the ships are represented by cardboards cutouts. Players have to use a periscope to direct and fire a total of 5 torpedoes, represented
        by lines of colored lights and sound effects, at the horizontally moving ships.

        <h2 id="s3">Legacy</h2>
        <p>
        Persicope was an unexpected success for Sega, as it did well in malls and department stores, locations which ususally don't host such machines. The game
        was succesful both in Japan and abroad. It created the standart for all future arcade games in the US and is described by some people as a <i>turning point</i>
        in the industry. Some pioneering features were the addition of sound and special effects. All in all, Periscope played a big part both in Sega's history, as well
        as in the market of electronic arcade gaming.
