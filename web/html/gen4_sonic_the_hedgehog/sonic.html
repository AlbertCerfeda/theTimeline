The protagonist, Sonic the Hedgehog, must find all the Emeralds in the various levels, before the antagonist does.

          Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D platform video game:the character must Srun at high speed through levels filled with enemies and obstacles to overcome. At the beginning, the player has three lives, which may be lost if Sonic collides with enemies or objects, falls or fails to arrive at the end of the level within the time limit.<br>
          Signposts allow Sonic to return to the most recent post when a life is lost, and time resets. The game ends when the player has no more lives, but, if there are continues, they can be used to get back to the beginning of the level. Gold rings play an important role: collecting 100 of them gives an extra life; moreover, collision when there are rings collected does not end in a life lost, but in the loss of all rings. The game is split into six principal zones, and each one is split into three acts, all of which must be completed. At the end of each zone's third act, the player has a boss fight with Dr. Eggman. Each main zone has its own style with unique enemies and obstacles. After completing all the zones, there is the final boss battle in the Final Zone, and the player must destroy the doctor's machine to win. If Sonic machine to win. If Sonic reaches the end of one of the first two acts  of a zone with at least 50 rings, he can jump through a large ring to enter a Special Stage, where he can collect more continues and hidden Chaos Emeralds.
