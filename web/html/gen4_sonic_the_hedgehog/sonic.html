          The plot of this game is very simple: the evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik, better known as <b>Dr. Eggman</b>, is trapping animals in robot suits and metallic capsules in order to find the six <b>Chaos Emeralds</b>, powerful gems which possess a great amount of energy. The protagonist, Sonic the Hedgehog, must find all the Emeralds in the various levels, before the antagonist does.

          Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrollingâ€“platform video game. Sonic must run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The enemies in the level are the robots in which animals have been trapped. The animals can be freed by destroying the robots, but it is not sufficient to win the game: the player must also avoid the various dangers and traps present in every level. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. At the beginning, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with enemies or objects, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit.<br>
          Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life.The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if the player has any continues. Gold rings play an important role: collecting 100 of them gives an extra life; moreover, collision when there are rings collected does not end in a life lost, but in the loss of all rings. The game is split into six principal zones, and each one is split into three acts, all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Eggman for a boss fight, and the doctor's vehicle is fitted with different weapons for almost every different occasion. The six zones are followed by a short 'Final Zone'. Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles. After the sixth zone, the player must battle the evil doctor in the Final Zone, where he has to destroy Dr. Eggman's machine to win. If Sonic reaches the end of one of the first two acts  of a zone with at least 50 rings, he can jump through a large ring to enter a Special Stage, where he can collect a number of continues based on the groups of 50 rings he have and the hidden Chaos Emeralds; it is possible to go back to the main game by colliding with one of the blockes marked ''GOAL''.
