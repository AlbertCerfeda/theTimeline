          <div class="text-img" id="text">
              <p>
              The Legend of Zelda is the first installment of the Zelda series. 
              The plot revolves around a boy named <b>Link</b>, who becomes the main protagonist of the series.
              The game came out in 1986 for the Famicom in Japan, and in 1987 in Europe and the US.
              It has since then been re-released for other consoles, such as the Nintendo GameCube and the Game Boy Advanced.
              The Japanese version of the game on the Famicom is known as <b>The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda</b>.
              </p>

              <h2 id="s2">Story</h2>
              <p>
              <b>Ganon</b>, the Prince of Darkness, has plunged a small kingdom in the 
              land of <b>Hyrule</b> into chaos. He leads his army into the land for one 
              objective, to steal the <b>Triforce of Power</b>, one part of a magical
              artifact that allows bestows great strength. <b>Princess Zelda</b>, who 
              doesn't want Ganon to continue on his path of destruction, decides to 
              split his next objective, the <b>Triforce of Wisdom</b> into eight fragments
              and hides them in secret underground dungeons. Before eventually being 
              kidnapped by Ganon, she asks Impa, her nursemaid, to find someone strong 
              and courageous enough to save the kingdom. While walking around the land,
              trying to complete her task, she gets surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, when 
              a young man called Link appears and rescues her. Upon hearing Impa's plea,
              he decides to save Princess Zelda. To do so, he goes out to collect the fragments
              of the Triforce of Wisdom, to have a chance to defeat Ganon.

          <h2 id="s3">Gameplay</h2>
          <p>The game itself introduces a new level of gaming, that
          includes role-playing, action, adventure, and puzzle/logic.</p>
          <h3 id="s3.1">Dungeon Exploration</h3>
          <p>
          For Link to enter the dungeons he must battle creatures.
          The dungeons in <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> are filled with enemies that block
          Link from going forward, which are different from the ones found in the
          <b>Overworld</b>. The objective of Link is to navigate successfully across the
          maze-like collection of rooms that are connected by doors and secret entrances
          to find a fragment of the Triforce of Wisdom. Each dungeon contains
          items that are useful to fight enemies, collect items, or to enter other
          dungeons, so the order of completion of the dungeons becomes natural throughout
          the gameplay.
          </p>

              <h3 id="s3.2">Overworld Exploration</h3>
              <p>
              The ability to complete a task in different ways or with different paths, also 
              known today as <i>non-linear gameplay</i> is what differentiates <i>The Legend
              of Zelda</i> from its contemporaries. Link can freely walk around the Overworld, 
              finding NPCs (non-player characters), finding or buying items, discover unseen
              places at any point. Nintendo US thought this freedom of wandering around could be
              frustrating or overwhelming so they decided to fill the game's manual with many
              tips and hints to help the player know where to go.

          </div>

          <h3 id="s3.3">Second Quest</h3>
          <p>
          Second Quest, or also known today as <i>New Game +</i>, is the possibility, once
          finished the game, to replay it with either item you possessed upon completed
          the first run or simply replaying the game with harder difficulty. Although
          this feature wasn't new at the time, <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>
          proposed it with entirely new levels, changing items locations, and
          stronger enemies.  The Second Quest is available even if the player
          didn't finish the game, he only had to enter "ZELDA" as his
          name.
          </p>
          <h2 id="s4">Game information</h2>
          <h3 id="s4.1">Development</h3>
          <p>
          Shigeru Miyamoto, who developed <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> but also
          the <i>Super Mario</i> franchise, created the game as a launch title
          for the Famicom. The intention behind <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> was
          to bring a sense of adventure, as he has seen in the <i>Indiana Jones</i>
          to a video game, so he started to explore the countryside and the
          hillsides neighboring his home to get inspiration for the new
          fictional world he was about to create.
          </p>
          <h3 id="s4.2">Graphics and Audio</h3>
          <p>
          Due to the technical limitations of the hardware at the time, the
          development team tried to use simple tricks to make the world look
          larger than what it was. One of these was to apply a
          different color palette for enemies, according to the region Link was.
          </p>
          <p>
          The main theme of the franchise was designed for this one, it's name
          is <i>The Overworld Tune</i>, although it has been re-orchestrated to
          fit the capabilities of the new generations of consoles. The game also
          possesses two other background themes: the <i>Standard Dungeon</i>
          tune and the <i>Final Dungeon</i> tune, both of which were re-used in
          other games of the franchise. Iconic sound samples, such as when Link
          opens a chest, finds a new item, or unveils a new path were often used
          in later games of the franchise.
