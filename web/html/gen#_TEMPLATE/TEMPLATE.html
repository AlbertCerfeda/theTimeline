As can be deduced from the etymology of its name, video game is a game that contrasts the player or players with a video (originally television, computer and other displays later). A video game is therefore a game that can be played thanks to an audiovisual device by electronically manipulating the images produced by a computer program, on a monitor or other display by pressing buttons and which can be based on a predefined or interactive story.

          The majority of early computer games ran on universities' mainframe computers in the United States and were developed by individuals as a hobby. The limited accessibility of early computer hardware meant that these games were small in number and forgotten by posterity.

The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research or just for recreation.
Thus games such as Bertie the Brain in 1950 to play tic tac toe, or Nimrod in 1951 for playing Nim. These systems used either electronic light displays and mainly as demonstration systems at large exhibitions to showcase the power of computers at the time.
Nearly everyone born within the past fifteen years naturally thinks of screens as both touchable and responsive to touch. But smartphones, tablets, and the other devices those kids have never known a world without will always look like technological marvels to their grandparents’ generation. Growing up in the 1950s as part of one of television’s most enthusiastic viewerships, they experienced the rise of that then-marvelous medium and the various concepts it tried out before settling into convention. Some may even remember happy Saturday mornings with CBS’ Winky Dink and You, the show that they didn’t just watch but actually “interacted” with by breaking out their crayons and drawing on the screen.

Back in the 1950s, TV ownership exploded in the United States. In 1949, just 2 percent of American households had a television. But by 1955, TV had invaded a whopping 64 percent of American households. And that gigantic first wave of television ownership brought new ideas about what TV could be. One idea was the first “interactive” TV show, which by today’s standards included some pretty primitive tech. Kids were encouraged to draw right on the TV screen with crayons. The only catch? You were supposed to buy a “magic screen” cover for your TV from the producers of the show.
The CBS show, titled Winky Dink and You, first aired on Saturday mornings in 1953 and was carried live by about 175 stations around the country during its first year. It became so popular that it was picked up on more stations and played on Sundays as well. And it showed that screen technology didn’t have to be a passive experience—provided you bought the proper supplies, of course.

Winky Dink, and Barry, often told them to draw in the missing parts of a picture, or to connect dots that would reveal a coded message.
E sebbene lo spettacolo sia riuscito a spostare due milioni di schermi magici, le preoccupazioni per i raggi X emanati dai tubi catodici (così come la probabilità che bambini impazienti disegnino direttamente sul vetro) terminarono la sua corsa nel 1957. Ma in un certo senso, la sua eredità vive su: una citazione molto diffusa attribuita a Bill Gates descrive Winky Dink and You "il primo programma televisivo interattivo", e sembra davvero aver aperto la strada a un tipo di contenuto che solo negli ultimi anni ha raggiunto la piena possibilità tecnologica. Chiunque abbia visto i bambini del 21 ° secolo giocare su smartphone e tablet noterà una sorprendente somiglianza con le attività guidate da Winky Dink e Barry.
