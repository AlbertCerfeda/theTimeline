          <i>Super Metroid</i> was released both in Japan and North America in
          1994, for the <i>Super NES</i>. The game is developed by <i>Nintendo
          R&D1</i> and published by <i>Nintendo</i>. It's the third installment
          of the series and it follows the events of the previous title for the
          <i>Game Boy</i>. The main character of the series is bounty hunter
          <i>Samus Aran</i>, who explores the 2D world of this <i>Metroidvania</i>
          platformer. The major elements of the game define in fact (in addition
          to elements from the classic <i>Castlevania</i>) a subgenre of its own.

          Super Metroid is a side-scrolling action-adventure game that involves
          exploration, platforming, and fighting various enemies and bosses. The
          player is given a lot of freedom in moving around the world, featuring
          big areas connected to each other through doors or elevators. This aspect
          of its design made the game particularly attractive to speedrunners
          (players who try to beat a game in the shortest time possible).
          <br>
          While progressing in the story Samus finds new power-ups that allow
          her to gain access to areas previously locked or inaccessible. Two of
          the most iconic upgrades available are for example the Morphing Ball,
          which allows Samus to curl into a ball and roll around, or the Grapple
          Beam, that can be used to swing across holes or obstacles.

        <h3 id="s1.2">Plot</h3>
        <p>
          The game takes place on the planet Zebes, from the original game,
          where Ridley (leader of the Space Pirates) took refuge with the stolen
          Metroid larva. The alien specimen was initially secured by Samus for
          scientific study, and it possessed inestimable value. After reaching
          Zebes she starts searching the planet for the Metroid. This journey
          brings her to fight various enemies, discover new areas, and defeat four
          main bosses, before reaching the classic final boss and the end of the game.

        <h3 id="s1.3">A truly Super Game</h3>
        <p>
          Super Metroid had an incredible reaction from the public and remains
          to this day one of the most praised games in the history of not only
          the SNES but the whole world of gaming. The mix of the classic 2D
          style, a challenging platforming experience, and incredible boss battles
          topped off with immersive music make this game a timeless gem.
