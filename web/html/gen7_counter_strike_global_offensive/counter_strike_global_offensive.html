        <h2 id="#s1">Introduction</h2>
          Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS GO for short) is a competitive first person shooter that was
          released by Valve on August 21, 2012. The premise of the game is a two-team game wherein one
          team is composed of terrorists and the other counter-terrorists; the objective being for the counterterrorists to stop the opposing side from planting a bomb.
        <h3 id="#s2">Gameplay</h3>

          Other than the aforementioned default gamemode there are more tradional ones such as deathmatch which, however,
          are not very popular in comparison. CS GO is quite unique in terms of its "gunplay", in other words the feel of
          shooting a gun. This is because it is made in a way that promotes a high level of mechanical skill. It does this
          by make the recoil patterns for a certain gun consistent, meaning that one can memorize it and land all bullets in a magazine
          on-target. It is also quite punishing in terms of gameplay because in many cases a single headshot can lead to death.

        <h2 id="#s3">Background</h2>
          CS GO is the third instalment in the Counter-Strike series, the first being Counter-Strike and the
          second Counter-Strike: Source. These two games garnered a sizeable player base when they were
          released (year 2000 and 2004 respectively) which immediately bled over to the nascent esports
          scene at the time, owing to the competitive nature of the game.

        <h2 id="#s4">Release</h2>
          CS GO was a highly anticipated game, the player base having waited for 8 years since the release of
          CS Source, and it aimed to not only improve graphics (as is traditional in subsequent games in a
          series) but also bring together the community which had previously split between the two previous
          games. Upon its release however, the game universally met with criticism. This was due to poor
          performance and a plethora of bugs, but also a completely foreign “feel” of the game compared to
          the one of its predecessors which people had grown accustomed to.

        <h2 id="#s5">Improvements</h2>
          After its rocky start Valve was determined to not abandon their game and continued to update and
          patch the game, bringing in new players as well as swaying old ones. But the player base was still
          relatively small compared to the numbers we see today; it only truly exploded in 2014 with the
          introduction of skins.
          <img src="media/csgo_skin.jpg" alt="A csgo skin" style="width:100%">
          Skins are cosmetic weapon finishes which are purchased with real money. This
          addition brought with it a massive influx of players, most likely because of the novelty they
          presented in an otherwise bleak game. Skins also introduced an entire micro-economy surrounding
          the game because one would be able to trade these skins with other players as well as sell them on
          the Steam (digital video game distribution platform owned by Valve) market. With a large player
          base, it was only natural that the corresponding esports scene exploded, with many tournaments
          taking place and record-breaking viewership of all CS GO events.

        <h2 id="#s6">Legacy</h2>
          CS GO has undoubtedly left its mark on the gaming scene. It might not have been very innovative in
          terms of technology, but it catapulted esports into the mainstream for the first time with the
          popularity of its tournaments, rivalling those of traditional sports. It is still highly popular today,
          being the most played game on Steam at almost any given moment, and consistently being in the
          top viewed categories on Twitch. It has also set the standard for competitive fps being one of the
          very first to have defined the genre.
