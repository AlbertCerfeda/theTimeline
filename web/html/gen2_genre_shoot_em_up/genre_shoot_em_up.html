        <h3 id="s1.1">Description</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          <strong>"Shoot'em up"</strong> (often abbreviated as <em>"shmup"</em>) is a subgenre of shooter games (which is a subgenre of action games).
           While there are many different opinions regarding the exact classification of shoot'em up among the critics, there are some characteristics that are common to most games considered part of this genre;
           for example the <b>restricted movement</b> of the playable character (unidirectional "on-rail" movement, fixed position with rotation,...),
           the <b>high amount of enemies/obstacles</b> coming from one or more sides of the screen (the <i>"them"</i> part of the genre's name), a <b>score system</b> quantifying how well the levels are played, ... <br>
        </p>
           <table class="center">
             <tr>
               <td><img src="media/space-invaders.gif" alt="Space invaders on Atari 2600" width=250></td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td><i>Space Invaders</i> on <i>Atari 2600</i></td>
             </tr>
           </table>
           <br>
        <h3 id="s1.2">Subgenres</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
           The specifics of these characteristics can also be used to further categorize shoot'em up games into various <b>subgenres</b> like "<b>side-scrolling shooters</b>" (featuring a horizontally scrolling action and a side-view perspactive),
           "<b>fixed shooters</b>" (with the action limited to a single screen and unidirectional movements), "<b>bullet hell</b>" (games where the screen is often full of the enemies' projectiles), ... <br>
           <br>
           Despite the arguably confusing categorization, the gameplay of these games is usually pretty straightforward: <b>move your character</b> with the right timing to <b>aim your shots</b> and to <b>avoid getting hit</b>.
           Nowadays most shoot'em up games are easily identifiable by simply looking at the similiarity of gameplay (due to design conventions of the genre) with other "shmup" games.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="s2">The shoot'em up genre in the second generation</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 id="s2.1">Important games</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Many of the design conventions mentioned previously come from the period of <b>high popularity</b> of these kind of games during the <b>second generation</b> of video games.
          One of the main responsible for this rise in popularity was <b><i>Space Invaders</i></b> (originally released as an arcade game, then appeared on the Atari 2600 and other consoles later on):
          it was one of the very <b>first games of the genre</b> and its success <b>influenced and inspired</b> many developers in making shoot'em ups. <br>
        </p>
          <br>
          <table class="center">
            <tr>
              <td><img src="media/asteroids-atari-2600.gif" alt="Asteroids" width=250></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><i>Asteroids</i></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
        <p>
          Like <i>Space Invaders</i>, many important shoot'em ups like <i>Asteroids</i>, <i>Defender</i>, <i>Galaxian</i> and <i>Missile Command</i> were ported on the Atari 2600.
          Looking at the <b>best selling games</b> on the Atari 2600 we can find many others shoot'em ups: <i>Demon Attack</i>, <i>Laser Blast</i>, <i>Yars' Revenge</i>, <i>Atlantis</i>, <i>River Raid</i>,... <br>
        </p>
          <br>
          <table class="center">
            <tr>
              <td><img src="media/missile-command.gif" alt="Missile Command" width=250></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><i>Missile Command</i></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
        <h3 id="s2.2">Gameplay</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          All of these games had their own take on the basic gameplay while <b>not changing the formula</b> too much; for example <i>Yar's Revenge</i> featured a "neutral zone" where the player couldn't get hit but couldn't shoot either.
          As we can see, shoot'em ups were some of the <b>most important and popular games</b> of the second generation, shaping not only games of the same genre but also the whole industry of video games at the time.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="s3">The evolution of the shoot'em up genre in the following generations</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 id="s3.1">Fading out of relevance</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          The <b>improved hardware</b> of the next generations allowed games to feature more <b>"complex"</b> gameplay, thus the <b>simplicity</b> of shoot'em up games <b>wasn't a necessary design element</b> as much as before.
          However that's not to say that shoot'em ups were forgotten: the genre has since continued to <b>evolve and adapt</b>, finding a <b>niche in the market</b> and developing <b>new mechanics and subgenres</b>
          (for example "<b>twin-stick shooters</b>", where the player is required to simoultaniously use two joysticks, one to move around and one to aim). <br>
        </p>
          <br>
          <table class="center">
            <tr>
              <td><img src="media/enter-the-gungeon.jpg" alt="Enter the Gungeon (2016)" width=250></td>
              <td><img src="media/cuphead.jpg" alt="Cuphead (2017)" width=250></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><i>Enter the Gungeon</i> (2016)</td>
              <td><i>Cuphead</i> (2017)</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
        <h3 id="s3.2">The recent resurgence</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          In particular on the last years with the rise of <b>"indie" games</b> (having more freedom on the choice of genre but less resources) and especially with the birth of <b>mobile games</b> for smartphones,
          the <b>simple but addictive gameplay</b> offered by shoot'em up games was once again quite appreciated.
          Some modern examples of relatively succesful shoot'em up games are <i>Enter the gungeon</i>(2016) and <i>Cuphead</i>(2017).
