          The <strong>Odyssey</strong> series was the main line of the first generation home consoles.
          Produced by <strong>Magnavox</strong> and <strong>Philips</strong> it included the
          <a href="../gen1_magnavox_odyssey/magnavox_odyssey.html">Magnavox Odyssey</a> in <b>1972</b>
          and all the next Odysseys until the <b>Magnavox Odyssey 2</b> in <b>1978</b> which was instead
          part of the <b>second generation</b>.

          The <b><a href="../gen1_magnavox_odyssey/magnavox_odyssey.html">Magnavox Odyssey</a></b> has been
          presented on May 24<sup>th</sup> 1972 becoming by this way the <b>first home console ever</b>.
          It had cards which were really similar to the subsequent <i>game cartridges</i> of the 2nd generation.
          All these ones were dedicated consoles so they included a predefined number of games.
          This one included a lot of different games but had a really bad market trend due to various reasons. <br>
          Its cost was of 100$ + 25$ for the <a href="../gen1_magnavox_odyssey/magnavox_odyssey.html">Shooting Gallery</a>.

        <img src="media/Odyssey_100.jpg" alt="Odyssey 100" width="300">
        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 100</strong> was launched in <b>1975</b> and Magnavox wanted to structured so that
          they could easly add features to it, but they didn't manage to do it because of <strong>Texas Instruments</strong>
          chips delay. The console foresaw Tennis and Hockey games where Tennis was simply a modified Pong.
          None of these displayed the score yet, but there was the possibility to power the console with eletricity. <br>
          Its cost was of $69.95.

        <h4 id="200">Odyssey 200</h4>
        <img class="left-img" src="media/Odyssey_200.jpg" alt="Odyssey 200" width="300">
        <p>
          The <strong>Odysseys 200</strong> was released in <b>1975</b> and consisted of an evolution of the previous one.
          It featured a new game called "Smash" and the possibility, for the first time to choose to play with
          four or two players. It also provided a displayed scorer thanks to a rectangle moving on to the right to add points.
          Everything else from the previous Odyssey was mantained and its cost was of 109.95$.

        <h4 id="300">Odyssey 300</h4>
        <img src="media/Odyssey_300.jpg" alt="Odyssey 300" width="300">
        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 300</strong> had a totally different structure from the previous one, satistfying the
          <a href="magnavox_odyssey"></a>initial desires of the series, in order to compete with <b>Coleco Telstar</b>.
          It appeared on the market in <b>1976</b> featured the same games as the previous version but added
          three different <b>difficulty levels</b> :Principiant, Intermediate and Expert. <br>
          Its cost was of 69$.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h4 id="400">Odyssey 400</h4>
        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 400</strong> was not really different from the previous one and it came in <b>1976</b>.
          This was basically the same as <a href="#200">Odyssey 200</a> but with the digital displayed score
          and the automatic service. <br>
          Its cost was of 100$.
        </p>
        <h4 id="500">Odyssey 500</h4>
        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 500</strong> was yet another evolution of the preceding console adding simple stylized icons
          representing the players (removing the old vertical lines) adjusting to each game (playing Tennis it would have had
          a racket in the hand and so on). <br>
          Out on the market in <b>1976</b>.

        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 2000</strong> was available since <b>1977</b> and was exactly the same as
          <a href="#300">Odyssey 300</a> but instead of three paddles it had only a rotating one. It also added a single
          player practice mode for Smash. <br>

        <h4 id="3000">Odyssey 3000</h4>

        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 3000</strong> appeared on the market in <b>1977</b> and added lots of features.
          To the previous four games nothing changed apart from the service and the reset
          (which could now be done thanks to their buttons). The design was totally different, the paddles were removable
          and the games were selectable thanks to a simple wheel. <br>

        <h4 id="4000">Odyssey 4000</h4>

        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 4000</strong> was the last one produced by <strong>Magnavox</strong> and was launched in
          <b>1977</b>. It featured 8 different types of the previous four games and had removable joystick.
        </p>
        <h4 id="5000">Odyssey 5000</h4>
        <p>
          The <strong>Odyssey 5000</strong> was simply a project that never really arrived to the market. Magnavox wanted
          to change everything but this was simply not the right way.

        <h3 id="philips">Philips</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Philips</strong> used to sell his own version of the <strong>Magnavox Odyssey</strong> paying rights
          to them until they bought it. They used to sell in Europe what was in America as for <a href="#P200">Odyssey 200</a>.
        </p>
        <h4 id="P200">Philips Odyssey 200</h4>

        <p>
          The <strong>Philips Odyssey 200</strong> arrived in Europe in <b>1976</b> and was exactly the same console

        <p>
          The <strong>Philips Odyssey 2000</strong> was a bad version of the one sold in America. In fact it didn't
          include the power supply and the paddles were the same as <a href="#300">Odyssey 300</a>.

        <p>
          The <strong>Philips Odyssey 2001</strong> was the <a href="#4000">Odyssey 4000</a> appearing in <b>1977</b> with
          the usual paddles and the sound unified with the televisor.
        </p>
