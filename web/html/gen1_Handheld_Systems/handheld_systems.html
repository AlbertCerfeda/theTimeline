          The Handheld systems were only dedicated consoles until the arrive, with the second generation, of
          the <b>Microvision</b> that provided the possibility to insert different games. Also, since the advent of
          the forth generation <b>Game Boy</b> all the others handled systems were eclipsed. <br>
        </p>

        <h2 id="console">Consoles</h2>
        <p>
          Between <b>1977</b> and <b>1982</b> the first handheld systems came out passing from the first
          <strong>Mattel Auto Race</strong> until the very first handheld system from Microvision.
        </p>
        <h3 id="auto">Mattel Auto Race</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Mattel Electronics Auto Race</strong> was the <b>first handheld game ever</b> to be totally digital.
          It was released in <b>1976</b> pioneering this category of games. The games was based on avoiding other cars
          arriving from the top while the player has to reach the top 4 times (4 laps) before the time ends (99 seconds,
          which is the limit in only two digits). It was also possible to change the velocity in a range of 4 but doing
          this the other cars will be as fast as we set, too. <br>
          Mattel also produced a very similar version of this product, the <strong>Battlestar Galcatica</strong>.
          Here the player rests at the bottom while trying to shoot the space navyes and if manages he gains points.

        <h3 id="football">Mattel Football</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Football</strong> was launched in <b>1977</b> and foresaw to make possible a football game on a
          9-yards camp. The market trend was thought to be bad according to a preview that was then discovered to be
          bad due to the high demand. It sold more than 500 000 units!

        <h3 id="simon">Simon</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Simon</strong> was a <b>memory skill</b> game where the player was supposed to repeat the sequence
          said by the console pressing the buttons which lighted on while sounding that tone.
        </p>

        <h3 id="quarterback">Electronic Quarterback</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Electronic Quarterback</strong> was out in <b>1978</b> and differs from the others handheld systems
          giving the possibility for the quarterback, adding two blockers, to pass the ball. But the game is still
          really similar to Football, but focused on the quarterback passing and runnning.
