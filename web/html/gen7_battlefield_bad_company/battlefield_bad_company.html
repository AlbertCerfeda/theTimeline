        <h3 id="s1.1"><u>General information</u></h3>
      <p>
        The game was released in North America the <b>23rd June 2008</b>, while in Europe three days later.<br>
        Part of the Battlefield series, this game is a first-person shooter game, originally developed for <b>PlayStation 3</b> and <b>Xbox 360</b>. <br>
        A direct sequel, <b>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</b>, was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows on <b>2 March 2010</b>. <br>
        Bad Company is <b>unique</b> as it was developed for consoles and features a full single player campaign
        with characters, as opposed to previous titles, which were mostly released for Windows and featured warfare, focused
        on multiplayer with large numbers of players.
      </p>
        <h3 id="s1.2"><u>Players</u></h3>
        <p>
          The player controls the protagonist Private Preston Marlowe and his exploits to steal gold from mercenaries along with his squad, in
          the midst of a war between the United States and Russia.
          In the game, players can hold one primary weapon, which has its own secondary, along with a combat knife, grenades and other picked up explosives and devices. <br>
          Players start with 100 health, which is reduced in case of damage. <br>
          Wounded players heal by using the LIFE-2 auto-injector.<br>
          The environment is almost entirely destructible, but bullets cannot go through most walls.
          Similar to another game, Battlefield 2142, the number of soldier classes is smaller compared to previous games in the series, resulting in a combination of the classic soldier classes. <br>
          The classes in this game are:
          <ol>
            <li>Assault</li>
            <li>Demolition</li>
            <li>Specialist</li>
            <li>Support</li>
          </ol>
          Each class wields a main weapon of choice (maximum of five optional guns per class), three secondary weapons/gadgets, and a knife for quick kills.
