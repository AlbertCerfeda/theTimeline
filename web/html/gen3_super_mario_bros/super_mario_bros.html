          <p cite="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda"><i>Super
              Mario Bros.</i> was an influential and groundbreaking game
          created by Nintendo and released on the NES in September 1985 in
          Japan. It was a <b>game-changer for the platformer style game</b>,
          thanks to its bright, expansive worlds.</p>

          <p cite="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda">Although the game is often credited as the first scrolling
          platformer (there were half a dozen earlier), it is the first console
          original in this genre to feature smooth-scrolling levels, which made
          it a landmark in home video-gaming.</p></div>

          <p cite="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda">The story wasn't the part of the game that was the most developed. It
          is a <b>simple structure</b> that was used in most of the future Mario games,
          each one with some slight variations:
          <ol>
              <li>Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach;</li>
              <li>Mario must roam the Mushroom Kingdom and defeat Bowser for the
              last time;</li>
              <li>Mario saves Peach and gets a kiss.</li>
          </ol></p></div>
          <div class="img-container text-img">
              <img src="http://cdn.lowgif.com/full/3a0fc1954758dcdc-1-up-mario-peach-nintendo-the-true-factory-of-dreams-and-fun.gif"
              alt="Peach kissing Mario"/>
          </div>

          <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
          <p cite="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda">The goal of the game is as Mario, or Luigi in the case of a
          second player, to go through the <b>Mushroom Kingdom</b>, defeat the enemies
          to ultimately fight <b>Bowser</b> and save <b>Princess Peach</b>. The main way Mario
          can defeat enemies is by jumping on top of ("Stomping") them. This
          action kills enemies known as <b>Gumbas</b>, and send the turtle soldiers
          known as <b>Koopas Troopas</b> into their shells, which Mario and Luigi can
          then kick into other enemies. These shells will conveniently dispatch
          the enemies they kick into, but on the other side, can <b>bounce back off walls</b>
          or others vertical obstacles, and come back into our protagonists,
          <b>hurting them</b> in their way. </p>
          <p cite="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda">Mario or Luigi can be hurt if they touch an enemy, but they can
          encounter objects known for being power-ups:</p>
          <div class="text-img">
              <ol>
                  <li><b>1-up</b>: causes Mario to gain a life;</li>
                  <li><b>Super Mushroom</b>: causes mini Mario (also known as "Regular
                      Mario") to grow (becomes Super Mario);</li>
                  <li><b>Fire Flower</b>: causes Super Mario to have the ability to shoot
                      fireballs;</li>
                  <li><b>Starman</b>: causes Mario to be impervious to the touch of enemy
                      characters and most obstacles.</li>
              </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="img-container text-img">
              <img style="border:none" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/89/88/5f/89885f5afec93f80cf5c6cf95debbdee.gif"
                  alt="Mario's forms"/>
          </div>
          <p cite="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda">If Super
          Mario or Fire Mario takes a hit from an enemy, then he reverts to
          Regular Mario, and at his turn, if Regular Mario takes a hit then he
          loses a life and starts again. However, regardless of status, if Mario
          <b>falls down into a pit</b>, into <b>lava</b>, or if <b>the timer runs
          out</b> then he loses a life and <b>starts again</b>, either from the
          start off from an invisible checkpoint partway through the level.</p>

          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games">The
          game, at his time, <b>broke a lot of records</b> when we talk about selling.
          To set some context, here are the top five best selling games, with
          their respective number of units sold, at the time <i>Super Mario
          Bros.</i> came out:
            <ol>
                <li><i>Pac Man</i> - 12.000.000 units</li>
                <li><i>Space Invaders</i> - 5.750.000 units</li>
                <li><i>Frogger</i> - 4.100.000 units</li>
                <li><i>Mario Bros.</i> - 3.850.000 units</li>
                <li><i>Tetris</i> - 3.200.000 units</li>
            </ol> 

          <h3 id="three_months">Three months after release</h3>
          The game such a success that no more than three months after it was
          released, it enters the top five with <b>3.800.000 units</b>, taking the
          place of <i>Tetris</i>. It also progressively stopped <i>Mario
              Bros.</i> from being sold.</p>

          months after its release, <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> arrives in the second
          position of the best selling game with <b>6.300.000 units</b>, getting in
          front of <i>Space Invaders</i> and behind <i>Pac Man</i> which is at

          takes a little <b>less than two years</b> for <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>
          to become the <b>best selling</b> game of <b>all time</b> (up until
          August 1987). It passes <i>Pac Man</i> with <b>14.000.000 units</b>
          and stays in front, gaining a worthy advantage, because two years later,
          it has <b>doubled its units</b>.</p>

          March 1993, over <b>seven years</b> after it's release and five of
          being the best selling video game, <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> loses
          its first place and is passed by <i>Tetris</i> with <b>48.000.000 units</b>

          June 2009, after <b>25 years of existence</b>, the game loses yet
          again a place in the charts, since it falls behind <i>Wii Sports</i>,
