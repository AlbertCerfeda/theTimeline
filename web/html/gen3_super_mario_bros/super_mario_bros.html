          <h1>Super Mario Bros.</h1>
          <h2 id="intro"></h2>
          <p><i>Super Mario Bros.</i> was an influential and groundbreaking game created
          created by Nintendo and released on the NES in September 1985 in
          Japan. It was a game changer for the platformer style game, thanks to
          it bright, expansive worlds.</p>

          <p>Although the game is often credited as the first scrolling
          platformer (there were half a dozen earlier), it is the first console
          original in this genre to feature smooth-scrolling levels, which made
          it a landmark in home video-gaming.</p>

          <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
          <p>The story wasn't the part of the game that was the most developed. It
          is a simple structure that was used in most of the future Mario games,
          each one with some slight variations:
          <ol>
              <li>Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach.</li>
              <li>Mario must roam the Mushroom Kingdom and defeat Bowser for the
              last time.</li>
              <li>Mario saves Peach and gets a kiss</li>
          </ol></p>

          <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
          <p>The goal of the game is as Mario, or Luigi in the case of a
          second player, to go through the Mushroom Kingdom, defeat the enemies
          to ultimately fight Bowser and save Princess Peach. The main way Mario
          can defeat enemies is by jumping on top of ("Stomping") them. This
          actions kills enemies known as Gumbas, and send the turtle soldiers
          known as Koopas Troopas into their shells, which Mario and Luigi can
          then kick into other enemies. These shells will conveniently dispatch
          the enemies they kick into, but on the other side, can bounce back off walls
          or others vertical obstacles, and come back into our protagonists,
          hurting them in their way. </p>
          <p>Mario or Luigi can be hurt if they touch an enemy, but they can
          encounter objects known for being power-ups:
          <ol>
              <li>1-up: causes Mario to gain a life;</li>
              <li>Super Mushroom: causes mini Mario (also known as "Regular
                  Mario) to grow (becomes Super Mario);</li>
              <li>Fire Flower: causes Super Mario to have the ability to shoot
              fire balls;</li>
              <li>Starman: causes Mario to be impervious to the touch of enemy
                  characters and most obstacles.</li>
          </ol></p>
          If Super Mario or Fire Mario takes a ht from an enemy, then he reverts
          back to Regular Mario, and at his turn, if Regular Mario takes a hit
          then he loses a life and starts again. However, regardless of status,
          if Mario falls down into a pit, into lava or if the timer runs out
          then he loses a life and starts again, either from the start of from
          an invisible checkpoint partway through the level.

          <h2 id="sellings">Selling</h2>
          <p>The game, at his time, broke a lot of records when we talk about
          selling. To set some context, here is the top five best selling games, with
          their respective number of units sold, at the time <i>Super Mario
          Bros.</i> came out:
            <ol>
                <li>Pac Man - 12.000.000 units</li>
                <li>Space Invaders - 5.750.000 units</li>
                <li>Frogger - 4.100.000 units</li>
                <li>Mario Bros. - 3.850.000 units</li>
                <li>Tetris - 3.200.000 units</li>
            </ol> 
          The game such a success that no more than three months after it was
          released, it enters the top five with 3.800.000 units, taking the
          place of <i>Tetris</i>. It also stopped <i>Mario Bros.</i> from being
          sold.</p>
          <p>Six months after it's release, <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> arrives in
          second position of best selling game with 6.300.000 units, getting in
          front of <i>Space Invaders</i> and behind <i>Pac Man</i> which is at 12.500.000.</p>
          <p>It takes a little less than two years for <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>
          to become the best selling game of all time (up until August 1987). It
          passes <i>Pac Man</i> with 14.000.000 units and stay in front, gaining
          worthy advantage, because two years later, it has doubled it's
          units.</p> 
          <p>In March 1993, over seven years after it's release and five of
          being the best selling video game, <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> looses
          it's first place and is passed by <i>Tetris</i> with 48.000.000 units
          sold.</p>
          <p>In June 2009, the game loose yet again a place in the charts, since
          it falls behind <i>Wii Sports</i>, in third place, at 48.150.000
          units.</p>
          <p>
          In 2020, <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> is still up on the charts, though
          not selling a lot, standing with 48.240.000 sales at sixth place,
          behind <i>Minecraft</i>, <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>,  <i>Tetris</i>,
          <i>Wii Sports</i> and <i>PlayerUnkown's Battleground</i>.
