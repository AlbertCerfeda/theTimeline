        <p>
          The <b>Game Boy</b> was first released in 1989 in Japan, followed by
          North America and Europe during the next year. The console is the first
          handheld of the <i>Game Boy family</i>, developed and manufactured by
          <i>Nintendo</i>. The project was managed by the same team which worked
          on the <i>Game and Watch</i> handheld consoles and many SNES games.
          <br>
          Even though the Game Boy isn't the first handheld developed by Nintendo,
          it had by far a bigger success than the first. The fact that its
          fourth-generation competitors were technologically superior still wasn't
          enough to stop this machine from making history. It is in fact only the first
          of a series of handheld consoles that shaped the market forever.

        <p>
          The Game Boy presents itself as a sturdy device equipped with a handful of
          buttons: four operation buttons labeled "A", "B", "SELECT", "START"; a
          directional pad; two dials for volume and contrast; a on-off switch. The
          user inserts the game cartridges in the slot situated at the top.
          <br>
          The console also contains some input/output connectors. It is in fact
          possible to plug a power supply jack for external rechargeable batteries,
          connect headphones and even link two consoles through the <i>link cable</i>.

        <p>
          In 1995 Nintendo started a new series of Game Boy models with colored
          cases. The technical sepcifications of the unit remain completely
          unchanged, but the introduction of these variations set a precedent
          for future Nintendo consoles in general.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="s2.2">Game Boy Pocket</h3>
        <p>
          The Game Boy Pocket was released in 1996 and consisted in a smaller,
          lighter unit that required AAA batteries and came at a lower price
          compared to its first iteration. This version also got several
          limited-editions, including for example a gold-metal model (exclusive
          to Japan).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="s2.3">Game Boy Light</h3>
        <p>
          Following the Pocket version, Nintendo introduced a last version of
          the Game Boy, called Game Boy Light. This system was released in 1998
          and featured a backlight for the screen, allowing the use of the console
          in low-light conditions. This iteration also brought back the AA batteries
          power supply, pushing the hours of gameplay to up to 20. This was one of
          the most important additions and was also used in future consoles (not in
          the direct successor though).
