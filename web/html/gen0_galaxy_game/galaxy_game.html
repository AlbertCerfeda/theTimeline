          <b>Galaxy Game</b> is an arcade game created in 1971 by Hugh Tuck and Bill Pitts at Stanford University.
          It was one of the first coin-operated video games. <br>
          The Galaxy Game is a reprogrammed version of <a href="../gen0_spacewar/spacewar.html"><i>Spacewar!</i></a> from 1962. Two human players are controlling two spaceships, engaged in a duel. <br>

        <h2 id="s2">History</h2>
        <h3 id="s2.1">1960s</h3>
          <p>
          Between 1966 and 1969, both university students Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck spent many hours playing the game Spacewar!, a magical game that captivated everyone who played it. <br>
          However, the time on mainframe computers that supported Spacewar! was charged to users at costs of a hundred dollars an hour. The developers of Spacewar! examined different ways to monetize the game but couldn't find any options due to the computers' high price.<br>
          Therefore, Spacewar! was usually played only by system programmers during times the mainframe was inactive, like 2 am.<br>
          During one of their gaming sessions, Tuck pointed out that a coin-operated version of Spacewar! could be very successful.
          </p>
        <h3 id="s2.2">1970s</h3>
          <p>
            In 1970 the Digital Equipment Corporation launched the PDP-11 minicomputer. Its launch resulted in a more accessible computer with the power to run Spacewar!. The PDP-11 minicomputer sold for about $ 14,000. The price was high compared to most arcade games, which cost about $ 1,000 each at the time. Nevertheless, Pitts and Tuck established the cost to be accessible enough to build a prototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bill Pitts was in charge of the programming and hardware, while Hugh Tuck designed the enclosures. The code for the game was based on a version of Spacewar!. The code has then been modified with additional features. Galaxy Game was ready to be released after three and a half months of labor.<br>
            Only one unit of the Galaxy Game was built, and it was installed at Stanford University in 1971.
          </p>
          <p>In 1972, the hardware got improved, allowing the processor to power up to eight consoles. This second version was installed in the Tresidder Union Cafeteria, where it remained until 1979.<br>
             During that period, the Galaxy Game was popular. Many students gathered around the machines on Friday and Saturday nights. In 1979 the unit was disassembled after being removed from Tresidder due to the display processor's unreliability.
          </p>
        <h3 id="s2.3">Recent years</h3>
          <p>In 1997 the unit was restored. Nowadays, it's part of the collection Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, as a playable exhibit.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="s3">Gameplay</h2>
        <figure>
          <center>
            <img src="media/galaxy_gameplay.png" alt="Galaxy Game - mainscreen" width="400">

        </figure>
          <p>
            The gameplay of the Galaxy Game is very similar to Spacewar!. It involved two monochrome spaceships, called "the needle" and the "wedge". The two players try to destroy each other's spaceships. To succeed, the spaceships fire torpedoes. To increase the challenge, the number of torpedoes is limited. The torpedoes are fired one at a time, and there is a "cool-down period" between each launch. <br>
            Besides firing, players can jump to hyperspace, rotate their ships, and also thrust forward. Both spaceships have a limited fuel consumed over time, and they explode when they run out of fuel.<br>
            One of the most exciting elements is the pull of a star in the middle of the screen. Both players must avoid falling into it.<br>
            The game also featured a single-player mode for practicing purposes.<br>
          </p>
          <p>The price of the game was ten cents per game or 25 cents per three games. The winner of the match was rewarded with a free game.</p>
