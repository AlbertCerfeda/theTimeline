        <p>
          Hitman is a third person action-stealth game developed by IO Interactive, where you get to play as Agent 47, a professional assassin. He goes to different locations around the world, solving a series of assassinations that seem to be unconnected. But this is not the only thing Agent 47 must do during the game: he must eliminate the targets given to him in each destination. The main story consists of 5 episodes, each of them with one map and their respective objectives. <br> Apart from the main plot, the game has an alternative stroyline called The Sarajevo Six, in which Agent 47 has to eliminate 6 former members of SIGMA who committed war crimes and evaded the prosecution. The difficulty incrases more and more each time you kill one of the 6 targets, because the ones who are still alive get more and more paranoid, increasing the security. There is one final bonus mission called patient zero, in which a cult is trying to attack with a bio-weapon. IN your first mission, your target is the leader of the cult, in the second mission you have multiple targets (the personel purposely infected to spread the bio-weapon), and in the final mission you take out the last infected person that could spread the virus.

        <h3 id="s1.2">Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
        As the player, you have multiple ways to assassinate the objective and complete the mission: from blending in and making the death look like an accident, to staying far from range and use a rifle. The game also shows its complexity by giving you different ways of approaching the target: for example: you could hear a phone call to get extra information of where the objective will be. But apart from the approaches, the game gives you a wide variety of weapons: guns (with equipment such as silencers), or the signature of Agent 47: the fiber wire. However, the enviroment, being as interactive and realistic as it is, allows you to pick up objects to use as weapos, such as bricks, a wrench, and even coins to throw, distracting the guardss and making it easier to get to your objective.

        <h3 id="s2.1">Why is it special</h3>
        <p>
        What makes Hitman special: this game is the 6th to enter the Hitman game series, and it showed a big gap with its predecessors in many ways. Of course, there is an easily noticeable change in the graphics, but itâ€™s the gameplay what makes it so much better: bigger maps, better AI stopping you from completing the missions and the complexity in the different approaches are some of the factors that made such a gap with older games of the serie.
