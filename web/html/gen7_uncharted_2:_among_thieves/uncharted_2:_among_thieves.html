        <h3 id="s2.2">plot</h3>
        <p>
           the story follows the main protagonist Nathan Drake, born Nathan morgan wo is an american treasure-hunter and explorer. Drake is lured back into
          the treacherous world of thieves and mercenary treasure-seekers he had sought to leave behind. When a mysterious
          artifact propels Drake on an expedition to find the legendary Himalayan valley of Shambhala, he finds himself embroiled in a dangerous game
          of cat-and-mouse against a fugitive war criminal who's after more than just the fabled riches of the lost city. Caught in a web of deception

        <h2 id="s3">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure platform video game played from a third-person view, with the player in control of Nathan Drake. Drake is physically
          adept and is able to jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed
          and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition
          from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have
          Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as sneaking up behind them to knock them out with one hit.

        <h3 id="s3.1">Trophies</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the game are 101 special treasures that may be hidden or in difficult-to-reach places that the player can collect. There is also one secret "hidden" relic exactly the same
          as the one in Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. Collecting these treasures, along with completing certain feats within the game, is tracked by the awarding of medals, which gives the player
          in-game money to use to unlock extra content on the disc, including concept art, game movies, and game cheats such as guns with infinite ammunition. A large portion of the in-game medals are used to award trophies.

        <br>
        <h3 id="s3.2"> Multiplayer</h3>
        <p>
          Uncharted features both competitive and co-operative multiplayer. The co-op multiplayer allows a maximum of three players to take the roles of Nathan and two other "hero" companions and features missions involving gunfights,
          platforming, and teamwork-based objectives. Players can also assist their comrades if they become critically injured or if they are grabbed by an enemy. The competitive multiplayer allows a maximum of ten players to play against
          each other in two teams of five. Six competitive modes are featured: Deathmatch, Plunder, Elimination, Turf War, King of the Hill and Chain Reaction. Deathmatch features two teams of five, with one team acting as heroes and the other
          as villains. Players can choose their own appropriate character models (such as Nathan, Elena, Sully and new characters Tenzin and Chloe for the heroes team). As players accrue points and rank up, they can purchase more skins for both heroes and villains.
          Players can select two Boost abilities which assist them in the matches.

        <h2 id="s4"> Development</h2>
        <p>
          Uncharted 2 uses Naughty Engine 2.0, a revamped and optimized version of the original engine that has allowed the game to have real-time moving environments, more realistic textures, and animations.
          The Naughty Dog Game Engine 2.0 also works in harmony with Havok Physics engine that provides a physics engine component and related functions to uncharted 2 among other games.

        <h2 id="s5"> Impact</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 id="s5.1"> Reception</h3>
        <p>
          Uncharted 2: Among Thieves received universal acclaim, being praised as one of the best video games of all time, and earning numerous "Game of the Year" awards, including VGX awards. The game has a <em>Gamerankings</em> score of 96.43%.
          The game also received a <em>metacritic</em> score of 96 out of 100, making it the most critically acclaimed game of 2009. The first publication to review Uncharted 2 was the French edition of <em>PSM3</em>. In their review, they called the game "Long, visually stunning,
          deep and explosive, Uncharted 2 combines all the qualities you can find in a videogame, and more! A new milestone has been reached in the videogame history." The magazine awarded the game 21/20, a score that was reached five years prior by Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
          PlayStation: The Official Magazine awarded the game a perfect score. In their review, they stated, "Forget Game of The Year. This is one of the greatest games of all time!" The UK edition of the magazine also gave the game a perfect score, named it the 2nd best PS3 game of all time,
          while readers of the same magazine voted it the greatest PlayStation title released at the time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="s5.2"> Imporatnce</h2>
        <p>
          The first Uncharted game was a killer game. But while the game had an interesting story, its frustrating and sometimes-buggy controls held it back from true greatness. Uncharted 2 fixed that. Better controls made traversing ruins and jungle landscapes exciting instead of frustrating, while an improved combat system transformed gunfights from chore to treat.
          Many games attempt to emulate cinema, dealing in the same themes and stock characters. Initially, it looks like Uncharted does the same thing – it focuses on a treasure hunter who frequently finds himself in danger across exotic locations. But when you play uncharted 2 it is obvious that it is on par and maybe even surpasses hollywood's recent output
          . Uncharted 2 is one of the finest AAA experiences yet even if it's 11 years old. it's a game that could be mistaken for cinema at almost every frame. Each chapter of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a masterfully written with immaculate detail, a satisfying adventure with plenty of heart that unravels at a blistering pace, moving the player from set piece to
          set piece in spectacular fashion

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Uncharted 2 didn’t just raise the bar for video game narratives, it launched it into the stratosphere and it will no doubt influence single-player games for the next generations.
