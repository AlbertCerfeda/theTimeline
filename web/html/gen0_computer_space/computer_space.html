          <b>Computer Space</b> is an arcade game created in 1971 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney.
          It was the world's first commercially sold coin-operated video game. <br>
          The Galaxy Game is a derivative version of <a href="../gen0_spacewar/spacewar.html"><i>Spacewar!</i></a> from 1962.<br>
        </p>

        <h2 id="s2">History</h2>
        <h3 id="s2.1">Context</h3>
          <p>
            In the 1970s, video games were played by programmers with access to computers at research institutions or large companies. One of those games was Spacewar!. <br>
            Spacewar! was extremely popular, but the time on mainframe computers that supported Spacewar! was charged to users at costs of hundred dollars an hour. <br>
            This high cost changed when Computer Space was released as the first commercial video game based on Spacewar!.<br>
          </p>
        <h3 id="s2.2">Beginning</h3>
          <p>
            When Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar! in 1969, he immediately concluded that it had great potential for an arcade game version. With that idea in mind, Nolan Bushnell showed Ted Dabney Spacewar!.  The two accepted working together to design a prototype of the game, but their design proved different difficulties.
          </p>
        <h3 id="s2.3">Development</h3>
          <p>
            The hardware was not powerful enough to run multiple games or refresh the monitors appropriately to make the games playable. The solution was to design custom hardware able to run the different functions. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founded in 1971 Syzygy Engineering as an official company. Nutting, a company founded in 1966, was looking for a game. Acknowledging this, they approached Nutting-Associates with their prototype. <br>
            Nutting agreed to manufacture the game while Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of it. Syzygy would be paid 5% of each machine sold. 
          </p>
        <h3 id="s2.4">Galaxy Game</h3>
          <p>
            As Syzygy and Nutting prepared for release, Bushnell heard that other engineers, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar!.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pair was developing a prototype of the <a href="../gen0_galaxy_game/galaxy_game.html"><i>Galaxy Game</i></a> when they met with Bushnell. <br>
            The Syzygy duo was relieved that the Galaxy Game was not an economically-competitive arcade game. <br>
            However, on the other hand, Pitts and Tuck considered the Computer Space just an imitation of Spacewar!, while the Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. 
          </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="s3">Release and Reception</h2>
          <p>
            In October 1971, Computer Space debuted. The game was popular with the viewers, calling it very promising.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial production was of 1,500 units of Computer Space. It was optimistic provided that a hit arcade game would sell 2,000 units.<br>
            The reception to Computer Space was mixed. Some were excited by the game, while others felt it was confusing.<br>
            In the spring of 1972, the game had sold over 1,000 units. It was a commercial success, making over $1,000,000, but it was also a disappointment to Nutting. They hoped for large-scale success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lack of success was due to the complexity of its controls. Computer Space also had a steep learning curve that pushed away customers used to less complicated games.
          </p>
          <br>
        <h2 id="s4">Gameplay</h2>
          <figure>
              <img src="media/gameplay.jpg" alt="Computer Space- mainscreen" width="600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
              <figcaption>Mainscreen</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The game takes place in outer space. The player controls a rocket ship as it attempts to shoot the enemies. The enemies in Computer Space are a pair of flying saucers.<br>
            The player-controlled rocket can be maneuvered through space using rotational buttons. The firing button is used to make the rocket fire missiles. When the enemies attack, they shoot missiles at the rocket. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The game's objective is to make the rocket destroy the flying saucers more times than the flying saucers can destroy the rocket.<br>
            The player must also try to overtake the flying saucers to get extended to play in hyperspace. If the player reaches hyperspace, the playing field will change from black to white and present a view of daylight in outer space. <br>
            The game ends if the flying saucers outscore the rocket, and the time expires.
