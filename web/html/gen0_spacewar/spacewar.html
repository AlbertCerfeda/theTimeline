        Spacewar! is a space war combat video game developed in 1962 by Stevel Russel, Martin Graetz, Wayne Wiitanen,
        Bob Saunders, Steve Piner, and others. It was created to be played on the new PDP-1 computer at MIT and later
        expanded to other machine variations.<!--variations of the machine.-->

        This game has been extremely influential in the history of video games, as it became incredibly popular for its
        time and was widely distributed because its public domain code was ported across different systems. It it still
        being recreated in modern programming languages today <!--to this day--> and has inspired many other games like <b>Galaxy Game (1971)</b>,
        <b>Compute Space (1971)</b>, and <b>Asteroids! (1979)</b>. It even has a place on the list of the ten most important video games of
        all time.

        <p>
        The game involves two monochrome spaceships. One is named <i>the wedge</i>, and the other <i>the needle</i>. They are
        both controlled by individual players, who have to maneuver on the two-dimensional space in the gravity well of a star
        in a starfield. The ships can fire torpedoes one at a time by pressing a button on the control pad, after which they have
        to wait for the cooldown until launching a new one.

        <p>
        The ships also have a fuel supply,<!--supply of fuel--> which they can use to fire their trusters and move around the map, though they remain
        in motion even when not accelerating. The players have to shoot down the other's ship and avoid colliding with the star or
        the enemy ship. The star can also be used for a gravity assist, though the player must <!--has to--> be careful not to fall in it. The game
        also features a wraparound effect, where any ship which moves past the edge of the screen comes out of the other side. Lastly,
        the ships are equipped with a hyperspace feature, enabling <!--which enables--> them to teleport to another screen location <!--location of the screen,--> after
        disappearing for a few seconds if they can't evade enemy torpedoes.

        <p>
        The basic concept for <b>Spacewar!</b> was developed back in 1961 by Russel, Graetz, and Wiitanen with the knowledge of the upcoming PDP-1.
        The science fiction novel Lensman Series was an inspiration for the game, which had descriptions of the spaceship encounters and
        space fleet maneuvers. While in the beginning, only simple programs were developed for the PDP-1 at MIT, Russel described the
        Spacewar! concept to the programming community with the hope that someone else would implement and not he himself. After being
        pressured by fellow community members, <!--members of the community--> he started explaining <!--the reasons--> why he cannot do it. This prompted his colleagues
        to help him with some parts of the game. In the end, Russel, with assistance from the other programmers, managed to finish the game
        in a total of 200 hours or around 6 weeks
