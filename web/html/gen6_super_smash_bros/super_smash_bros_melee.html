        <h3 id="s1.1"><u>General information</u></h3>
        <p>
          A followup for the GameCube, Super Smash Bros. Melee, was released in <b>Japan</b> and <b>North America</b> in late <b>2001</b>, and in
          Europe and Australia in May 2002. It had a larger budget and development team compared to Super Smash Bros. It was acclaimed among critics and consumers and since its release, Super Smash Bros. Melee
          has sold more than <b>7 million copies</b> and was the bestselling game on the GameCube. In addition, there are 29 stages and it features <b>26</b> characters, 15 of which are available initially (twice as much as the number of characters of its
          predecessor) <br>
          In place of Super Smash Bros "character profiles", Melee introduced <b>trophies</b> (called "figures" in the Japanese version).
          The <b>293 trophies</b> include three different profiles for each playable character, one unlocked in each single-player mode.
        </p>
        <h3 id="s1.2"><u>Players</u></h3>
        <p>
          Two new single-player modes alongside the Classic mode were introduced:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Adventure mode</b></li>
          <li><b>All-Star mode</b></li>
        </ol>
          <b> The Adventure mode</b> has platforming segments similar to the original's "Race to the Finish" mini-game. <br>
          <b>All-Star</b> instead  is unlocked by unlocking all of the characters in the game. In this mode, the player fights through every character in the game with one life.
          With the exception of Mr. Game & Watch, the characters appear in a random order on each play-through, 25 of whom are always the enemies in the last fight.
          Finished the mode, the player will earn the Smash Blue trophy of the character that they are playing with.
          <br>
          In addition, in Melee there is the <b>Home-Run Contest mini game </b>, in which the player(s) must knock a Sandbag as far as possible, usually with the Home-Run Bat given. The player has ten seconds to rack up damage to lengthen the home-run
          It replaced <b>Board the Platforms</b> in the original game.<br>
          Additionally, the game featured alternative battle modes, called "Special Melee," which allows players to make many
          different alterations to the battle.
