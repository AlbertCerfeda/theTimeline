          <p id="intro">Metroid is the first installment of the Metroid Series,
          both chronologically, and in release order. It was released for the
          Famicom Disk System in August 1986 and one year later on the Nintendo
          Entrainment System.</p>
          <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
          <p>On Planet SR388 was discovered a new life form in suspended
          animation, called "Metroid". The Galactic Federation (a congress
          composed of representative from several planets in the galaxy) decided
          to send a research vessel to go and retrieve it. However, as it
          returned, the vessel was attacked by Space Pirates, who stole the
          capsule containing the Metroid and took it to their fortress on Planet
          Zebes.</p>

          <p>After recognising the potential threat of the Metroids as Space
          Pirate weapons, they attempt to recuperate it by attacking Zebes, but
          fail. And so, as a last resort, the Federation hires Samus Aran to
          infiltrate the planet and to prevent the Space Pirates from creating
          more Metroids and to defeat the Pirate leader on Zebes, Mother Brain.</p>

          <p>Samus manages to go through the planet's underworld in search of to
          high-ranking Space Pirates, Kraid and Ridley, both of whom she
          eventually locates and destroys. By that time, the main Space Pirate
          headquarter on Zebes, Tourain, is filled with Metroids. However, Samus
          dispatches them and confronts Mother Brain, destroying her. In the
          eventuality of her defeat, Mother Brain programmed a bomb to detonate,
          Samus manages fortunately to escape before it detonates and takes
          every last Metroid with it.</p>

          <h2 id="gampelay">Gameplay</h2>
          <p>This game is much like a mix between <i>Castlevania</i> and
          <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, because it combines the precise platformer
          elements and the weapon upgrading of <i>Castlevania</i> and the
          openness of <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, having the possibility to go
          around somewhat freely around the planet of Zebes, but still having to
          upgrade the weapons Samus has in order to access new areas. The weapon
          with which the player starts with is a weak, short-ranged weapon, but
          she can improve her abilities by finding various upgrades scattered
          throughout planet Zebes, such as the Long Beam, to improve her
          weapon's range and the Morph Ball, to access small tunnels.
          </p>
          <p>
          In additions to these upgrades, Samus can find energy tanks and
          missile tanks to carry more health and missiles, which are
          occasionally dropped after destroying an enemy. In order for the to
          enter Tourain, Samus' goal, the area is unavailable until she finds
          and defeats Kraid and Ridley, who are located in hideouts beneath
          Brinstar and Norfair and serve as the game's boss encounters.
          </p>

          <p>The original Famicom Disk System version allowed players to save
          their progress. However, on the NES version, players had to use
          password to continue where they left off after the game restarted. The
          password was usually given to the player at the moment of death of
          Samus. An interesting feature that the game has is it's multiple
          endings. The endings are not determined by choices made throughout the
          game (as would be done in modern games), since there are no choices to
          make, but by the amount of time a player takes to complete the whole
          game. Depending on time, they will get one of five endings:
          <ul>
              <li>10 or more hours: Samus covers her face and turns back to the player;</li>
              <li>Under 10 hours: Samus faces the player with one arm raised in the air;</li>
              <li>Under 5 hours: Samus removes her helmet, revealing her true face;</li>
              <li>Under 3 hours: Samus removes her Power Suit, and is seen in a
              leotard;</li>
              <li>Under 1 hour: Samus removes her Power Suit, and is seen in a
                  bikini.</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>If the player manages to achieve either of the latter two endings in
          the NES version, they will be able to restart the game with Samus
          outside of her Power Suit and all upgrades they previously had
          (excluding Energy and Missile Tanks). The difference, however, is
          purely cosmetic and doesn't affect regular gameplay.</p>
