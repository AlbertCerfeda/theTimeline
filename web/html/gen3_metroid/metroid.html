              both chronologically, and in release order. It was released for the

          SR388</b> was discovered <b>a new life form</b> in suspended animation, called
          "Metroid". The <b>Galactic Federation</b> (a congress composed of a
          representative from several planets in the galaxy) decided to send a
          research vessel to go and retrieve it. However, as it returned, the
          vessel was attacked by <b>Space Pirates</b>, who stole the capsule containing
          the Metroid and took it to their fortress on <b>Planet Zebes</b>.</p>

          recognizing the potential threat of the Metroids as Space Pirate
          weapons, they attempt to recuperate it by attacking Zebes but fail.
          And so, as a last resort, the Federation hires <b>Samus Aran</b> to
          infiltrate the planet and to prevent the Space Pirates from creating
          more Metroids and to defeat the Pirate leader on Zebes, <b>Mother
          Brain</b>.</p>

          manages to go through the planet's underworld in search of two
          high-ranking Space Pirates, <b>Kraid</b> and <b>Ridley</b>, both of whom she
          eventually locates and kills. By that time, the main Space Pirate
          headquarters on Zebes, <b>Tourain</b>, is filled with Metroids. However,
          Samus dispatches them and confronts Mother Brain, <b>destroying her</b>. In
          the eventuality of her defeat, <b>Mother Brain programmed a bomb</b> to
          detonate, Samus manages, fortunately, to escape before it detonates
          and takes every last Metroid with it.</p>

          <p cite="https://www.metroidwiki.org/wiki/Metroid_(game)">This game is
          much like a mix between <i>Castlevania</i> and <i>The Legend of
          Zelda</i>, because it combines the <b>precise platformer</b> elements and the
          <b>weapon upgrading</b> of <i>Castlevania</i> and the <b>openness</b> of <i>The Legend
          of Zelda</i>, having the possibility to go around somewhat freely
          around the planet of Zebes, but still having to upgrade the weapons Samus
          has to access new areas. The weapon with which the player starts with is a
          <b>weak</b>, <b>short-ranged weapon</b>, but she can improve her abilities by finding
          various upgrades scattered throughout planet Zebes, such as the <b>Long Beam</b>,
          to improve her weapon's range and the <b>Morph Ball</b>, to access small tunnels.
          </p>

              <p cite="https://www.metroidwiki.org/wiki/Metroid_(game)">
              In addition to these upgrades, Samus can find <b>energy tanks</b> and
              <b>missile tanks</b> to carry more health and missiles, which are
              occasionally dropped <b>after destroying an enemy</b>. For the to
              enter Tourain, Samus' goal, the area is unavailable until she finds
              and defeats Kraid and Ridley, who are located in hideouts beneath
              <b>Brinstar</b> and <b>Norfair</b> and serve as the game's boss encounters.

          <h3 id="progress_endings">Progress and endings</h3>

          <p cite="https://www.metroidwiki.org/wiki/Metroid_(game)">The original
          Famicom Disk System version allowed players to <b>save their progress</b>.
          However, on the NES version, players had to use a <b>password</b> to continue
          where they left off after the game restarted. The password was usually
          given to the player at the moment of the death of Samus. An
          interesting feature that the game has is its <b>multiple endings</b>. The
          endings are not determined by choices made throughout the game (as
          would be done in modern games), since there are no choices to make,
          but by <b>the amount of time</b> a player takes <b>to complete the whole game</b>.
          Depending on time, they will get one of five endings:

          <ul>
              <li><b>10 or more hours:</b> Samus covers her face and turns back to the player;</li>
              <li><b>Under 10 hours</b>: Samus faces the player with one arm raised in the air;</li>
              <li><b>Under 5 hours</b>: Samus removes her helmet, revealing her true face;</li>
              <li><b>Under 3 hours</b>: Samus removes her Power Suit and is seen in a leotard;</li>
              <li><b>Under 1 hour</b>: Samus removes her Power Suit, and is seen in a
                  bikini.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p cite="https://www.metroidwiki.org/wiki/Metroid_(game)">If the
          player manages to achieve either of <b>the latter two endings</b> in the NES
          version, they will be able to restart the game with Samus outside of
          her Power Suit and <b>all upgrades</b> they previously had (excluding Energy
          and Missile Tanks). The difference, however, is <b>purely cosmetic</b> and
          doesn't affect regular gameplay.</p>
