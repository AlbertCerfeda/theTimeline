          It was released in Japan in 1988 and in North America and PAL regions the following years. Mega Man 2 continues Mega Man's battle against the evil Dr. Wily and his rogue robots.
          It introduced graphical and gameplay changes, many of which became series staples.

        <h2 id="s2">Plot</h2>
        <p>
          Mega Man 2 takes place one year after the original Mega Man. After his initial defeat Dr. Wily, the series' main antagonist, creates his own set of Robot Masters in an attempt to counter Mega Man: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man,
          Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man.
          He also constructs a new fortress and army of robotic henchmen. Mega Man is then sent by his creator, Dr. Light, to defeat Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters.[7] Mega Man defeats the eight new Robot Masters and then challenges Wily himself.
          During the final fight, Dr. Wily flees into the caves beneath his fortress and when Mega Man follows, attempts to trick Mega Man into thinking he is a space alien, but Mega Man defeats the alien revealing it to be a holographic projection
          device which malfunctions showing Dr. Wily at the controls.
          After the scientist begs for mercy, Mega Man spares Wily and returns home.

      <h2 id="s3">GamePlay</h2>

      <p>
        Mega Man 2 is a platform and action game like its predecessor, Mega Man. The player controls Mega Man as he traverses eight stages to defeat the bosses, Dr. Wily's Robot Masters: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash
        Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man.
        Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon's power. </p>

      <p>
        For example, Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky-themed level, while Wood Man can use a shield of leaves and is found in a forest-themed stage. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon becomes available to the player.
        The Robot Masters have weaknesses to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing the order in which the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay. After completing certain stages,
        Mega Man receives a special item. These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that he otherwise could not.

      <p>
        Keiji Inafune claims the success of Mega Man 2 is what made the Mega Man series a hit that continues to spawn sequels. 1UP.com commented that the game helped establish the series as a <em>prominent and commercially successful video game
          franchise</em>.
        IGN cited Mega Man 2 as helping define the platforming genre.Retro Gamer credited it with helping the series obtain the global presence that allowed spin-offs and more sequels to be created. Many of the conventions of the original Mega Man
        series were defined by the first game,
        but Mega Man 2 added crucial conventions that were retained for the rest of the series. The traditional number of Robot Masters for the series is eight as used in Mega Man 2, rather than the six used in the original.<br />
        <strong><em>It was the first in the series to include an opening cinematic</em></strong>
