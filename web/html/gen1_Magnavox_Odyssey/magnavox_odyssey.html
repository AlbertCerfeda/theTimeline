        <h3 id="dawn">The Dawn of an Era</h3>
        <p><i>Magnavox Odyssey</i> has been the first home video game console ever to appear on the market.
          An year after the release of <i>Bucket Filling Game</i> in <b>1967</b>, <strong>Ralph Baer</strong>
          started working on <i>Odyssey</i> in <b>1968</b>, but it's been on the market only between <b>1972</b>
          and <b>1975</b> (also due to the <a href="#market_trend">small success</a>). <br>
          Now known as the <i>"Brown Box"</i>,
          it's preserved in the National Museum of American History in <i>Washington</i>.</p>
          <img src="media/Magnavox-Odyssey-Console-Set.jpg" alt="Console Set" width="300">
        <h3 id="spread">The Spread of an idea</h3>
        <p>The idea of the game was early noticed and since the arrival on the market of <strong>Pong</strong>,
        <strong>Magnavox</strong> had to sue lots of important companies, such <strong>Atari</strong>(the Pong creator),
        Coleco, Mattel, Seeburg, and Activision, always resulting as the winner.<br>
        <strong>Nintendo</strong> then tried to sue them saying they were copying <i>Tennis for Two</i> but still couldn't win
        against <strong>Magnavox</strong> and their terrible lawyers. <b><i>Nice try Nintendo!</i></b><br>
        The company then produced other similar models of <strong>Odyssey</strong> mantaining the same structure
        (<a href="../gen1_Odyssey_Series/odyssey_series.html">The Odyssey series</a>). </p>

        <h2 id="g_and_c">Games & Console</h2>
        <h3 id="console">Console</h3>
        <h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
        The console was based on the usage of two main <strong>controllers</strong> that commanded two of the three
        displayed squares, thanks to which it was possible to play different games. In fact it was possible to use different
        <b>special cards</b> to play (one per time, of course) and 6 of them were already with the console while the remaining 6
        had to be bougth apart from the packet. After the users had decided which game to play he would have been supposed to
        add in front of the monitor the corrispondent skin in order to add the components needed to play (such as the bar for tennis).
        <br>
        In fact the cNOME COGNOMEontrollers had two heigths on both sides relatively controlling (from the left-side) the horrizontal and vertical
        movement of the square. The console used to be sold together with some papers in order to count the points.

        <h2 id="curiosities">Curiosities</h2>
        <h3 id="market_trend">Market trend</h3>
        <p>The product didn't succeed for multiple reasons: there was a corridor entry which brougth people to think it could
          only work on <strong>Magnavox</strong> TVs, or only on color ones and not on the black-and-white ones.
          That wasn't obviously true, but together with its high cost (100 $ for the console + 25 $ for the <a href="#pistol">pistol</a>),
          it brougth the console to the failure selling "only" <b>330 000 units</b>. <br>
          In <b>1975</b> the company stopped producing it to move on the new <a href="../gen1_Odyssey_Series/odyssey_series.html#odyssey100">
            Odyssey 100</a></p>
        <h3 id="games">Possible Games</h3>
        For this model 27 games have been producted between 1972 and 1973 to improve the client pleasure.

        <p>Another particular idea <strong>Bear</strong> had was the <strong>Shooting Gallery</strong>, which wasan optic pistol
        sold apart from the console. It looks like a shotgun and its purpose is to kill in the game thanks to a photocell individuating
        ligths on the screen and not. In fact this was easly distractable even with a simple ligth bulb... Also due to its additional
        cost of 25$ it experienced very bad.</p>
