    <h1 id="s1">Valve Corporation </h1>
<p>Valve Corporation, also known as Valve Software, is an American video game developer, publisher, and digital distribution company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. It is the developer of the software distribution platform Steam and the Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Portal, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead, and Dota series.</p>

<h2 id="s1.1">Virtual reality, Source 2, and new games</h2>
<p>Valve announced the Source 2 engine in March 2015, and ported Dota 2 to it that September.[51][52] In 2016, Valve release the HTC Vive VR headset, developed in collaboration with the Taiwanese electronics company HTC, and the Steam VR client.</p>
<p>Valve bought Impulsonic, a developer of 3D audio software, in January 2017 and integrated it into its Bellevue offices.[55] In April 2018, Valve acquired the independent developer Campo Santo, known for the 2016 adventure game Firewatch. Campo Santo planned to develop its own games under Valve, though they initially helped develop Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
<p>In June 2019, Valve released its second-generation VR hardware, the Valve Index.</p>
<p>In March 2020, after several failed attempts to develop further Half-Life projects, Valve released Half-Life: Alyx, a VR game.[62] Valve felt there was demand for a large-scale VR game, and found that Half-Life best suited VR. Designer Robin Walker said that Half-Life 3 had been a "terrifyingly daunting prospect", and the team saw VR as a way to return to the series.[63] Alyx entered full production using Source 2 engine in 2016, with the largest team in Valve's history.[64] Half-Life: Alyx received acclaim[65] and was described as VR's first killer app.</p>

<h1 id="s2">Devellopment of Half-Life: Alyx </h1>
<p>Half-Life: Alyx entered development around February 2016,[30] and entered full production later in 2016.[6] The team, comprising around 80 people,[31] was the largest in Valve's history, and includes Campo Santo, a studio Valve acquired in 2018.[7][2] Valve's Source 2 engine includes better support for VR and collaborative level editing, and Valve plans to release a new Hammer level editor for Source 2. Valve also plans to release a partial Source 2 software development kit (SDK) for the updated features at a later date, with the focus at launch on shipping and supporting Alyx.</p>
<p>Half-Life: Alyx was planned to serve as the flagship title for Valve's in-house VR headset, the Valve Index, and was due to release in the summer of 2019 to coincide with the launch of the Index. Six months before this planned release, Valve held an internal playtest with its employees to gauge their feedback. While the game's design, gameplay, and level progression was resoundingly praised, the actual story (written by Rob Yescombe of The Invisible Hours) was heavily criticized for being too bizarre and not in line with the Half-Life universe. To rectify this, Alyx was delayed, and Erik Wolpaw (who had left Valve to work on Psychonauts 2) was re-hired to work alongside Jay Pinkerton and Sean Vanaman on completely redoing the story while preserving the basic gameplay.</p>
<P>Valve kept all information about Half-Life: Alyx from the public until the game's announcement on November 19, 2019. The public's only knowledge about the title came from leaks and rumors concerning a Half-Life title utilizing VR technology. This title was then known simply as "HLVR", never given an official codename. Beginning as early as late 2016, leftover lines of code referring to HLVR within Dota 2 began to appear. These strings suggested new weapons and NPCs, and referred to familiar Half-Life creatures (such as Vortigaunts and Zombies). Fans, at the time, speculated the leftover data was related to the development of Half-Life 3.</P>
<P>The generally accepted narrative about HLVR started to change in 2019 when rumors, leaks and interviews with Valve employees started to suggest that HLVR would be a prequel focused on Alyx Vance, set to release some time in 2020. This latest batch of rumors turned out to be true with the announcement of Half-Life: Alyx.</P>
<p>Half-Life: Alyx received an update on May 28, 2020. Among other things, the update included a "boozy liquid shader" for all bottles in game, courtesy of Valve artist Matthew Wilde who referred to it as his lockdown project.[3]</p>
