          The game begins with Link riding his horse through a forest, where he meets the main antagonist, the <b>Skull Kid</b>, wearing a mask, who steals his horse and his ocarina, lures him into a dark cave,
          curses him and escapes through the help of his two fairies. One of them, called <b>Tatl</b>, is left behind, and joins Link in order to be able to reunite with her friends. After walking through the
          cave, they find themselves in a clocktower, where they meet the <b>Happy Mask Salesman</b>, who offers to help the hero after he gets back <b>Majora's Mask</b>,the mask stolen from the Skull Kid.
          Once entered in the town, set in the land of <b>Termina</b>, where a festival is being prepared, they learn of a curse cast on the city by the Skull Kid. Three days after, despite the effort
          of the protagonist, the Skull Kid uses the mask to make the moon crash on the town, destroying it in the process. However, Link had managed to get his ocarina back, and by playing a song he and Tatl go
          back in time, three days earlier. They meet the Happy Mask Salesman again and Link is freed from his curse. The salesman, however, is worried about the non-returned mask: the object has such a terrible
          and evil power that in the past it had been sealed in order to prevent catastrophic consequences.
          To save Termina and the entire world, the hero has to travel to all four regions of the land, lift their curses and free their guardian giants. After lifting all four curses, Link meets the Skull Kid
          again and blocks the moon with the help of the giants, but he has to beat the mask, which flies away from the Skull Kid towards the moon, where the final battle against the hero and a monstrous form of
          Majora's Mask is held. In the end, Tatl reunites with the other fairy Tael and the Skull Kid, the giants go into a sleep, the salesman gets his mask back and the town finally celebrates the festival.

          The gameplay of Majora's Mask expands on that of the previous games: it retains the concept of <b>dungeon puzzles</b> and <b>ocarina songs</b> and introduces new elements including
          <b>character transformations</b> and  the <b>three-day cycle</b>. As in previous installments, Link can perform basic actions and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles.
          Link's main weapon is a sword, and other weapons and items are available Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows  and the use of special items.
          Similar to the other games, the player has move through several dungeons with numerous puzzles that must be solved in different ways depending on the theme; the player can also obtain a map and a
          compass for further assistance, but they are not necessary. The player also has to find a key to unlock the boss' room.<br>
          An element of novelty are little fairies, which can be collected and can give the player
          additional attacks. Around the image are icons representing time passed, the player's health, magic, money, items and possible actions.<br>
          Masks have a central role in the gameplay: Link can transform himself at will into different creatures thanks to them, and each form features unique abilities that can also affect the accessibility
          of certain areas of the game.<br>

          Majora's Mask imposes a <b>time limit of three days</b> (72 hours) in game time, which is about 54 minutes in real time. Link can return to 6:00 am of the first day by playing a song on the ocarina
          before the end of the time limit, otherwise the moon will destroy Termina and the player will get a game over. A real-time countdown will begin when only 6 hours remain.Returning to the first day
          will not affect the player's progress, however minor objects, keys, unstored money and resolved puzzles will be lost. Link can use his ocarina to perform several actions, such as slowing down the time.
          The form of the instrument is affected by the protagonist's current transformation.<br>

          Possible interaction with crucial NPCs and possessed items are indicated by a notebook.

          The game runs on an improved version of the game engine used in the previous games, but <b>requires the use of the Expansion Pak</b>, which allows you to see farther, improves the lighting dynamics,
          gives more detailed texture and animation, complex framebuffer effects (i.e. motion blur) and more characters on the screen. The expanded distance allows the player to see far into the world of the
          game,and eliminates the use of a fog to obscure distant areas, technique used in the previous installments of the series. Moreover, the interiors of the buildings are rendered in real time, unlike the
          "fixed" interiors used in game production up to the previous game.<br>
