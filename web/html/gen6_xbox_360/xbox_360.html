            The Xbox 360 controller is the primary game controller for Microsoft's Xbox 360 home video game console that was introduced at E3 2005. The Xbox 360 controller comes in both wired and wireless versions.
            The Xbox controller is not compatible with the Xbox 360. The wired and wireless versions are also compatible with Microsoft PC operating systems, such as Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.
            The wireless controllers run on either AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack. The wired controllers may be connected to any of the USB ports on the console, or to an attached USB hub.

                  Many of these problems were corrected with Microsoft's releases of the Xbox controller S and then the Xbox 360 controller. IGN credited the Xbox 360 controller for its being one of "the most ergonomically comfortable console controllers around".
                  It was also praised for its improved button placement, its functioning logo as a button, and Microsoft's choice of bottom-mounting headset ports as opposed to top-mounting them so as to minimize snagged wire problems

           <p>
            Known during development as Xbox Next, Xenon, Xbox 2, Xbox FS or NextBox, the Xbox 360 was conceived in early 2003. In February 2003, planning for the Xenon software platform began, and was headed by Microsoft's Vice President J Allard.
            That month, Microsoft held an event for 400 developers in Bellevue, Washington to recruit support for the system. Also that month, Peter Moore, former president of Sega of America, joined Microsoft. On August 12, 2003, ATI signed on to produce
            the graphic processing unit for the new console, a deal which was publicly announced two days later. Before the launch of the Xbox 360, several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple's Power Mac G5 hardware. This was because the system's
            PowerPC 970 processor running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox 360 would eventually run under IBM's Xenon processor. The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation 3's Cell Processor PPE architecture.
            According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps, the IBM employees were "hiding" their work from Sony and Toshiba, IBM's partners in developing the Cell Processor.

           <h3 id="s5.1"> Launch</h3>
           <p>
            The Xbox 360 was released on November 22, 2005, in the United States and Canada; December 2, 2005, in Europe and December 10, 2005, in Japan. It was later launched in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,
            India, and Russia. In its first year on the market, the system launched in 36 countries, more countries than any other console has launched in a single year at the time.

           <br>
           <h3 id="s5.2"> Reception</h3>
           <p>
            In 2009, <em>IGN</em> named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25.
            Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by <em>Techradar</em> to be the most influential,
            by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards.
            PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it "proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space".
            the 360 was also praised for it's PC-like architecture that meant that  the early <em>EA sports</em> games ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3.
            Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list, and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next-generation exclusive.
            And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 controller which is another industry benchmark.
           </p>
           <br>
           <h3 id="s5.3"> Importance</h3>
           <p>
            The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh generation, it is regarded as a success since
            it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most
            console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012.
            The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality games, making it far less dominant than its predecessor,
            the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and games to reach parity with the Xbox 360. <em>Techradar</em>
            proclaimed that "Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One"
           </p>

           <h2 id="s6"> Red ring of death</h2>

           <table width="90%">
            <tr>
                <td>even though the xbox 360 was very succesful their were complications that made Microsoft receive alot of backlash one of the most famous ones being "the red ring of death"
                  The Red Ring of Death is when three flashing red lights around the Xbox 360 power button instead of the one to four green lights indicating normal operation represent an internal problem that requires service.
                  This error was soon nicknamed the "Red Ring of Death", "Red Lights of Death" or "Red Ring of Doom" by users, echoing Windows' Blue Screen of Death error. Warning signs may include freeze-ups, graphical problems
                  in the middle of gameplay, such as checkerboard or pinstripe patterns on the screen, and sound errors, and the console only responds to pressing the power button to turn it off. These events may happen once or
                  several times until the hardware failure occurs, or not at all. if it wasn't for Microsoft taking action and refunding the dead xboxs it was estimated by analysts that microsoft's consumer
                 trust would have never recovered thus completely taking them out of the console gaming industry.
