        <p>
          Doom is a <i>first-person shooter</i> game developed by id Software for MS-DOS in
          1993. The player takes the role of an unnamed space marine that fight hordes
          of demons from Hell, in a science fiction and horror scenario.
        </p>
        </br>
        <h3 id="s1.2">Description</h3>
        <p>
          The player has to go through a series of levels set in military
          bases on the moons of Mars and in Hell. To finish a level the player must
          explore the area to find a marked exit room while walking a map is
          filled with the location you went through. The levels are grouped into episodes
          and the last level features a <i>boss fight</i> where the player has to face
          an enemy stronger than the others encountered before. </br>
          The enemies are demons and possessed undead humans that the
          player fights using different weapons. During the game, the player must
          manage ammunition, health and armour. There are 5 difficulty levels:
          those manage the amount of damage done by enemies, the speed of
          their movements and if they respawn. </p>

        <h3 id="s1.3">Why is Doom so well known?</h3>
        <p>
          It was one of the first videogames rated M for Mature due
          to his violence and explicit content. It was also criticized by groups
          for the content of satanic imagery. Doom introduced the fear that the new
          technology used in videogames led to more realistic simulations that could
          influence people making them more confident using violence. </br>
          It's a challenging game that requires the player to be concentrate to
          complete a level but is also nice to play just for having fun, so a lot
          of people loved it. It was also one of the first FPS genre games. </p>
        </br>
        </br>
        <h2 id="s2">Innovations</h2>
        </br>
        <h3 id="s2.1">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The fact that Doom was played by millions of people promoted the emerging
          FPS genre. However, the term FPS was lately introduced and the firsts videogames
          that followed this structure were called "Doom clones".
          This game pioneered online distribution, 3D graphics, networked
          multiplayer gaming and custom modifications via packaged files (WADs). </p>
        </br>
        <h3 id="s2.2">Multiplayer</h3>
        <p>
          Deathmatching between players became attractive due to the
          large distribution of PC systems and the violence of this game, so players
          started playing one against the other in different ways: over phone line
          using a modem or by linking two PCs with a null-modem cable. </p>
        </br>

        </br>
          <h3 id="s2.3">Graphic</h3>
        <p>
          The levels are presented in 3D perspective but the enemies and the objects are
          2D sprites presented from several angles. This technique is called
          2.5D graphics. For this generation, this kind of new graphic was a huge
          innovation and had a big impact on the games that were afterwards developed. </p>

        </br>
          <h3 id="s2.4">Mods</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to modify the game creating custom levels using WAD files. This
          feature generated a large community that started making mods. The mod files
          also allow to create and modify creatures, weapons and even the sounds. </p>
